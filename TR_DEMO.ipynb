For such a flight, the chosen path is typically the Great Circle Route - the shortest path between two points on a sphere, which minimizes distance and thus fuel consumption. The aircraft would generally fly a path that is a compromise between the shortest distance and the prevailing wind patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "In this case, the flight would head in a general eastward direction, taking advantage of the prevailing westerlies – winds that blow from the west towards the east in the mid-latitudes. This is where the wind speed of 20.0 m/s comes into play. Flying with the wind, as opposed to against it, can increase the ground speed of the aircraft and consequently reduce the flight time and fuel consumption.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speed of the aircraft (240 m/s) is also taken into consideration when planning the flight path. The plane would need to maintain this speed relative to the air mass it is flying through, so the flight path would need to account for any areas of slower or faster air movement.\n",

            "As for time dilation and spacetime curvature, these are phenomena predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation refers to the idea that time passes at different rates in regions of varying gravitational potential; the higher the gravity, the slower time passes. Spacetime curvature is the warping of spacetime caused by gravity. While these effects do exist, they are extremely small on the scale of an airplane flight and are generally not considered in the planning of a flight path. For instance, a flight at 35,000 feet for about 7 hours (typical for Montreal to London) would only experience a time dilation of about 0.0005 seconds. As such, the effects of relativity do not have a practical impact on flight planning.\n",
