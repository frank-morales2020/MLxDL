            "\n",
            "1. Upon arrival at DFW, Bob can store his carry-on bag at one of the airport's luggage storage facilities. Many airports, including DFW, offer this service for a fee.\n",

            "\n",
            "3. Bob can visit the Dallas Museum of Art, which offers free general admission. He can explore the museum's extensive art collection for about 1.5 hours.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. After the museum, Bob can walk to Klyde Warren Park (about 10 minutes) and enjoy a quick stroll or relax in the park for about 30 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Next, Bob can walk to the nearby food trucks or restaurants in the area for a meal. Some popular options include Rusty Taco, The Slow Bone, or Food Truck Lane. He can allocate about $15-20 for a meal and spend around 1 hour enjoying his food.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. To return to the airport, Bob can take the DART Orange Line from St. Paul Station (a 5-minute walk from Klyde Warren Park) back to DFW Airport Station. The trip takes about 50 minutes.\n",
            "\n",
