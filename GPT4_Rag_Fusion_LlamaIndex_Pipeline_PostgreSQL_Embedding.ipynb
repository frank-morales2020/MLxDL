The regularization term encourages the weights (parameter values) of the model to be small and effectively reduces the model’s complexity. This balances the trade-off between bias (how well the model fits the data) and variance (how much the model changes for different datasets).\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **2002**: Amazon Web Services was first launched as a free service that offered data on Amazon's popular products.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **2006**: AWS officially launched its first cloud product, the Simple Storage Service (S3), setting the company on its path to cloud services. In the same year, AWS also launched Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows individuals and businesses to rent virtual computers to run their applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **2007**: AWS started the AWS Partner Network, focusing on helping businesses move to the cloud.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **2008**: AWS added Elastic Block Store (EBS), providing raw block-level storage, and introduced the first availability zone in Europe.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **2009**: AWS expanded again, this time with the introduction of Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). \n",
            "\n",
            "6. **2010**: AWS rolled out new services like Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring AWS resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **2011**: AWS experienced its first major outage, which led to the company enhancing its infrastructure and redundancy measures. This year also sees the launch of AWS GovCloud for U.S governmental agencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **2012**: AWS introduced Redshift, a data warehousing product. This year also marked their first-ever AWS re:Invent, annual user conference.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **2013**: AWS launched several user-friendly tools, such as AWS CloudHSM and Amazon AppStream. \n",
            "\n",
            "10. **2014**: AWS Lambda a serverless compute service was launched.\n",
            "\n",
            "11. **2015**: AWS announced AWS Snowball, a physical storage device for large-scale data transfer. \n",
            "\n",
            "12. **2016 onwards**: AWS continued to grow, adding more services like AWS Shield for DDOS protection, AWS Macie for data privacy, and AWS Glue for ETL workloads.\n",
            "\n",
            "13. **Present Day**: Today, AWS offers over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally in areas such as computing power, storage options, networking, databases, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things (IoT). It's continuously innovating and expanding its portfolio to meet new market demands.\n",

            "LISP, which stands for \"LISt Processing,\" is a programming language known for its unique approach to computation. It was originally developed by John McCarthy in the late 1950s as a formal model of computation, aiming to be an alternative to the Turing machine. LISP's core concept involves defining a language by writing an interpreter in itself. Over time, LISP evolved into a full-fledged programming language, gaining power and elegance due to its origins as a model of computation. McCarthy's initial LISP interpreter was later expanded to include essential features that were not part of the original design. Despite its complex nature, LISP's ability to be defined and modified within itself has made it a fascinating subject for exploration and development.\n",
