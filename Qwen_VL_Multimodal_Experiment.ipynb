            "#### **1. Imaging Findings and Rationale for Diagnosis**  \n",
            "The CT images demonstrate **classic features of stercoral colitis**, a condition caused by *massive fecal impaction leading to ischemic inflammation* of the colon. Below is a breakdown of the findings:  \n",
            "\n",
            "- **Colonic Distention and Large Stool Burden**:  \n",
            "  - Panels A and B reveal *significant dilation of the colon*, particularly in the sigmoid and rectosigmoid regions, consistent with a **large stool burden** (fecal impaction). This is the cornerstone of stercoral colitis, as the impaction physically compresses the bowel wall.  \n",
            "  - The presence of **soft tissue density** within the colon (vs. gas or fluid) confirms the stool is dense and compacted, not transiently distended from gas or fluid.  \n",
            "\n",
            "- **Mural Thickening (White Arrows, Panels A and B)**:  \n",
            "  - The circumferential thickening of the colonic wall reflects *edema and inflammation* due to ischemia from prolonged pressure on the bowel wall. In stercoral colitis, mural thickening is typically **segmental** (confined to areas of impaction) and homogeneous, distinct from the heterogeneous or nodular thickening seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  \n",
            "\n",
            "- **Perirectal Fat Stranding (Yellow Arrows, Panel C)**:  \n",
            "  - This is **reactive inflammation** surrounding the rectum, caused by the ischemic colon wall. Fat stranding is a hallmark of tissue necrosis/ischemia, indicating the bowel is no longer viable due to prolonged pressure from the impaction.  \n",
            "\n",
            "- **Clinical Context**:  \n",
            "  - The patient’s history of **chronic constipation** (a major risk factor for stercoral colitis) combined with acute symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting) aligns with the *acute decompensation* of chronic fecal impaction. Autistic spectrum disorder often contributes to behavioral barriers to toileting, worsening constipation.  \n",

            "|---------------------------|-----------------------------|  \n",
            "| **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)**<br>(Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis) | - IBD typically presents with *chronic* symptoms, skip lesions, or mucosal ulcerations (not seen here).<br>- Crohn’s disease often involves *segmental wall thickening with nodularity* or fistulae, which are absent.<br>- Ulcerative colitis causes *continuous mucosal inflammation* with ulcerations, not focal stool-related thickening. |  \n",
            "| **Neoplastic Causes**<br>(Colorectal Cancer) | - Age (23 years) is too young for colorectal cancer (median age: 70–75).<br>- No mass, irregular wall thickening, or lymphadenopathy visible on CT. |  \n",
            "| **Mechanical Obstruction**<br>(Volvulus, Adhesions, or Intussusception) | - Mechanical obstruction causes *proximal distension with air-fluid levels*, but here the distension is **due to stool burden** (not obstruction).<br>- No signs of obstruction (e.g., dilated small bowel loops, bowel wall pneumatosis) or mechanical causes. |  \n",
            "| **Diverticulitis** | - Typically involves *left lower quadrant pain* and *diverticula* (not visible here).<br>- Unlikely in a young, otherwise healthy patient. |  \n",
            "| **Ischemic Colitis** | - Occurs in older patients with vascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes).<br>- Here, the **distension and stool burden** are the primary drivers, not ischemia alone. |  \n",

            "Stercoral colitis carries a **high risk of complications** due to severe impaction:  \n",
            "- **Focal-Pressure Necrosis**: Prolonged pressure on the bowel wall causes *venous congestion → ischemia → tissue necrosis*. This is evidenced by the mural thickening and fat stranding.  \n",
            "- **Perforation**: If necrosis progresses, the bowel wall may rupture, leading to **peritonitis** (surgical emergency). Key red flags include worsening pain, fever, or signs of systemic sepsis.  \n",
            "- **Immediate Action**: If the patient deteriorates (e.g., fever, rebound tenderness), **urgent surgical evaluation** is required to rule out perforation.  \n",

            "- **Debridement**:  \n",
            "  - **Colonoscopy** (preferred): To evacuate stool (e.g., with a rectal catheter or manual evacuation under sedation).  \n",

            "- **Surgical Consultation**: If there is suspicion of perforation or failure of medical therapy, emergency colectomy may be needed.  \n",
            "\n",
            "##### **Follow-Up Imaging**  \n",
            "- **Repeat CT**: If symptoms persist or worsen (e.g., signs of perforation), to assess for complications.  \n",
            "- **Colonoscopy**: Post-acute phase to confirm resolution of inflammation and rule out IBD (if symptoms recur).  \n",
            "\n",
            "##### **Long-Term Management for Puborectalis Dysfunction**  \n",
            "The patient’s chronic constipation likely stems from **puborectalis muscle dysfunction** (hypertonicity or spasm), which impairs stool passage.  \n",
            "- **Anorectal Manometry**: Quantifies rectal sensation, pelvic floor pressure, and coordination. Essential to diagnose dysfunctional defecation.  \n",
            "- **Pelvic-Floor Physical Therapy**:  \n",
            "  - Targets *hypertonic puborectalis* with biofeedback and manual therapy.  \n",
            "  - Includes *behavioral strategies* (e.g., scheduled toileting, digital stimulation) to retrain bowel habits.  \n",
            "- **Behavioral and Dietary Modifications**:  \n",
            "  - High-fiber diet, stool softeners (e.g., docusate), and behavioral therapy (critical for autism patients to overcome toileting resistance).  \n",

            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **5. Conclusion**  \n",
            "The CT findings (massive stool burden, mural thickening, perirectal fat stranding) combined with the patient’s history of chronic constipation and acute symptoms **strongly support stercoral colitis**. While IBD, neoplasia, or mechanical obstruction must be ruled out, the imaging and clinical context make stercoral colitis the most likely diagnosis. Immediate intervention for stool evacuation is critical to prevent perforation, followed by long-term management of puborectalis dysfunction to prevent recurrence.  \n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Takeaway**: Stercoral colitis is a *preventable complication* of chronic constipation. Early recognition and aggressive management of stool burden are paramount, especially in vulnerable populations like patients with autism spectrum disorder.\n"

            "   - **Significance**: Distention proximal to an obstruction (fecal impaction) is classic. In chronic constipation, fecal material accumulates distally (e.g., rectosigmoid), causing proximal colonic dilation. This explains the distension pattern seen in all images.  \n",

The imaging findings (distention, soft tissue density, fat stranding, wall thickening) directly correlate with mechanical obstruction and mucosal irritation from impaction. Prompt clearance of the impaction, followed by long-term pelvic floor-focused management, is essential to prevent complications and address the underlying ASD-related bowel dysfunction. Early intervention with PFPT and anorectal manometry will optimize outcomes for this patient.  \n",

            "> **Key Takeaway**: Chronic constipation in ASD often stems from pelvic floor dysfunction, leading to impaction. Imaging here reflects this mechanism, with findings that are highly specific to obstruction rather than inflammatory or neoplastic causes. Long-term success depends on addressing both acute symptoms and underlying neurological contributors to constipation.\n",

            "#### **Rationale for Diagnosis**  \n",
            "The patient’s **clinical history (chronic constipation, autism spectrum disorder)** and **acute symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting)** strongly suggest a **fecal impaction** as the primary cause of obstruction, leading to secondary **ischemic inflammation** (reactive colitis). Imaging findings align with this mechanism:  \n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Colon Distention (Images A, B, C)**:  \n",
            "   - Marked distention in the sigmoid colon (Image B) and lower pelvic colon (Image A) is consistent with **functional obstruction** from fecal impaction. Chronic constipation (especially in autism, where sensory aversion to bowel movements may lead to stool withholding) predisposes to impaction.  \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Soft Tissue Density in Colon (Images A, B, C)**:  \n",
            "   - The soft tissue density within the colon reflects **hardened fecal matter** (impaction). In chronic constipation, stool can calcify or become dense, appearing as soft tissue density on CT. This is distinct from neoplastic masses (which would show irregular borders or calcification) or fluid-filled dilations.  \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Pericolonic Fat Stranding (Images B, C)**:  \n",
            "   - Fat stranding (streaky densities adjacent to the colon) is a hallmark of **reactive inflammation** due to ischemia from impaction. Impaction causes mechanical obstruction, reducing blood flow to the distal colon, leading to mucosal edema, inflammation, and reactive fat stranding.  \n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Colon Wall Thickening (Image C)**:  \n",
            "   - Increased wall thickness in the axial view (Image C) is **not due to neoplasia** but rather **mucosal edema** from ischemia. This is a classic sign of secondary inflammation in fecal impaction, where bowel ischemia triggers an inflammatory response.  \n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Absence of Fat Stranding in Image A**:  \n",
            "   - Fat stranding is not visible in the coronal plane (Image A) because the obstruction is more pronounced in the lower pelvis/sigmoid (where pericolonic inflammation is more likely to develop). This does not rule out the diagnosis, as inflammation may be more localized to the distal colon.  \n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Lack of Mass-Like Structure (Image B)**:  \n",
            "   - The \"mass-like structure\" in Image B is **not a neoplasm** but likely a **fecal impaction** mimicking a mass. In chronic constipation, impacted stool can appear as a rounded or irregular density, distinct from neoplastic masses (which would show irregular borders, enhancement, or lymphadenopathy).  \n",
