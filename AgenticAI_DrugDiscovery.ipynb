            "Targets identified: Based on the comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer's Disease mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities, here are the 3 most promising biological targets for intervention:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Amyloid-beta (AÎ²) Peptides**  \n",
            "   *Justification:* As a core pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's, AÎ² oligomers and plaques demonstrate direct neurotoxicity by disrupting synaptic function, triggering inflammation, and promoting tau pathology. Genetic evidence from APP/PSEN mutations in familial Alzheimer's confirms its causal role. Recent clinical validation comes from monoclonal antibodies (Lecanemab, Donanemab) showing statistically significant slowing of cognitive decline through amyloid clearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Tau Protein (Hyperphosphorylated)**  \n",
            "   *Justification:* The spread of pathological tau tangles correlates strongly with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Unlike amyloid, tau directly impairs neuronal structure and function by disrupting microtubule stability and axonal transport. Multiple therapeutic approaches are in late-stage trials, including aggregation inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, and immunotherapies targeting cell-to-cell propagation.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Neuroinflammation Pathways (Microglial Activation)**  \n",
            "   *Justification:* GWAS studies identify microglial genes (TREM2, CD33) as major risk factors. Chronically activated microglia drive neurodegeneration through cytokine storms (IL-1Î², TNF-Î±), oxidative stress, and synaptic damage. Emerging strategies like TREM2 agonists aim to convert microglia from neurotoxic to neuroprotective states while enhancing AÎ² clearance.\n",
            "\n",
            "These targets represent mechanistically validated intervention points where recent clinical successes (AÎ²) and strong genetic/disease-progression evidence (tau, neuroinflammation) converge. Combination therapies addressing multiple targets simultaneously show particular promise for modifying disease progression.\n",
