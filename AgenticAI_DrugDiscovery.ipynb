            "Targets identified: 1. Amyloid-beta (AÎ²) Plaques: Targeting aggregated AÎ² forms (protofibrils/plaques) promotes clearance and reduces brain amyloid burden. This is the most clinically validated target, with monoclonal antibodies like lecanemab and donanemab demonstrating significant slowing of cognitive decline (22-29%) in Phase 3 trials for early Alzheimer's, leading to FDA approvals.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Tau Pathology: Reducing pathological tau forms (phosphorylated tau/neurofibrillary tangles) prevents neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Strong biomarker correlations with disease progression and ongoing Phase 2/3 trials of anti-tau antibodies (e.g., zagotenemab, bepranemab) show target engagement and preliminary clinical benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Microglial Function (TREM2/APOE pathways): Modulating microglia addresses core genetic risks (TREM2 mutations/APOE4). TREM2 agonists and APOE-targeted therapies in Phase 2 trials leverage overwhelming genetic validation to enhance AÎ² clearance and suppress neuroinflammation, representing a promising frontier for disease modification.\n",

            "2. **Tau Pathology**: Tau Aggregation Blocker (TAB) â€“ Hypothetical small molecules preventing tau misfolding by binding to aggregation-prone regions (e.g., PHF6 motif), inhibiting neurofibrillary tangle formation.  \n",
            "3. **Microglial Function (TREM2/APOE pathways)**: TREM2/APOE Synergist â€“ Compound class enhancing TREM2-APOE interactions to boost microglial phagocytosis of AÎ², leveraging brain-penetrant scaffolds mimicking natural lipid ligands.\n",

            "   - **Reason**: Shows potential for modest cognitive improvement (20-50% slowing) by targeting toxic protofibrils, but efficacy is constrained by blood-brain barrier penetration challenges and the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's pathology.  \n",

            "   - **Reason**: Could achieve 20-30% slowing of decline by enhancing microglial phagocytosis of AÎ² and reducing neuroinflammation, but efficacy is limited by complex microglial biology dynamics and APOE isoform-specific effects.\n",
