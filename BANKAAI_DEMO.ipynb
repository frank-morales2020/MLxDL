            "Okay, so I've got this application in front of me, and I need to make a decision based on these specific policies. The first thing I always do is break down the requirements. It's like a logical puzzle.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm starting by checking if the application should be outright rejected. The policy says *reject* if the credit score is below 600. The applicant's credit is 720, so that's a no-go on rejection. Good.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, I look for the auto-approve criteria: credit above 780, loan under $100k, and a \"GREEN\" fraud status. The loan *is* under $100k, and the fraud is \"GREEN,\" but the credit score of 720 falls short of that 780 threshold. So, no auto-approval here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, I check for the flagged conditions.  It's an \"OR\" statement, meaning if *either* the loan exceeds $50k *or* the fraud is \"RED,\" the application gets flagged. The loan amount is $75,000, which is definitely over $50k.  That *definitely* triggers the flag.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, the decision is clear: FLAGGED.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, I need to construct the reasoning. I want to be specific, explaining *why* it wasn't rejected or auto-approved, and *why* it was flagged. It boils down to this: the credit score is good, but it doesn't meet the auto-approve standard, and the loan amount pushes it over the flagging threshold. I should express the applicant's credit score relative to the thresholds, and explicitly state that the loan exceeds $50,000.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, I need a risk score. Given that the fraud is \"GREEN,\" and the income is solid relative to the loan, it's not a *high* risk. The credit is decent, and that 720 is good to be on the books. The only \"risk\" comes from the loan size. It should be a pretty low-medium score, so... maybe a 35? That feels about right.\n",
