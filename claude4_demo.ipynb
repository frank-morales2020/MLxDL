            "## 2. Mitigation Strategies\n",
            "\n",
            "### For Clear Air Turbulence:\n",
            "1. **Flight Planning:**\n",
            "   - Request initial cruise altitude FL340 or below until past 140W longitude\n",
            "   - Plan step climb to FL380+ after clearing CAT advisory area\n",
            "   - Load additional contingency fuel (3-5%) for potential altitude deviations\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Operational Procedures:**\n",
            "   - Brief cabin crew on enhanced turbulence protocols\n",
            "   - Consider service suspension over CAT area (approximately 30-45 minutes)\n",
            "   - Maintain seat belt sign illuminated FL340+ over Pacific\n",
            "   - Request pilot reports (PIREPs) from preceding aircraft\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Real-time Monitoring:**\n",
            "   - Utilize WSI or similar turbulence forecasting tools\n",
            "   - Monitor ACARS turbulence reports from company aircraft\n",
            "   - Be prepared for immediate descent to FL340 or below if severe CAT encountered\n",
            "\n",
            "### For Military Restricted Airspace:\n",
            "1. **Pre-departure Coordination:**\n",
            "   - File flight plan with specific routing to avoid R0005/25\n",
            "   - Coordinate with dispatch for optimal departure time\n",
            "   - Consider OFFSHORE or COASTAL departure procedures from SFO\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Contingency Planning:**\n",
            "   - Have alternate routing via DINTY or similar waypoints ready\n",
            "   - Calculate additional fuel burn for 50-75NM deviation\n",
            "   - Brief crew on possible holding procedures\n",
            "\n",
            "### For Destination Weather:\n",
            "1. **Approach Planning:**\n",
            "   - Review ATIS/METAR trends for PHNL 2 hours prior to arrival\n",
            "   - Brief both ILS 8R and RNAV 4R approaches\n",
            "   - Set conservative approach minima (add 100ft/Â½SM to published)\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Fuel Planning:**\n",
            "   - Ensure adequate holding fuel for one missed approach\n",
            "   - Verify alternates (PHOG Kahului, PHTO Hilo) weather remains suitable\n",
            "\n",
            "### For Jet Stream Headwinds:\n",
            "1. **Fuel Management:**\n",
            "   - Add 5-7% additional contingency fuel for headwind component\n",
            "   - Consider tankering fuel from KDEN if price differential favorable\n",
            "   - Plan for possible technical stop in California if winds exceed forecast\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Flight Planning Optimization:**\n",
            "   - Request multiple altitude options for most favorable winds\n",
            "   - Consider slight southern deviation for reduced headwind exposure\n",
            "   - Update FMC winds every 30 minutes using real-time data\n",
            "\n",
            "## 3. Overall Go/No-Go Recommendation\n",
            "\n",
            "**RECOMMENDATION: GO** - Proceed with flight as planned with the following mandatory conditions:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Required Actions Before Departure:\n",
            "1. Increase fuel load by 8-10% above flight plan (combined contingency for CAT, headwinds, and potential routing changes)\n",
            "2. Verify restricted airspace R0005/25 status with ATC and have alternate routing filed\n",
            "3. Brief all cabin crew on enhanced turbulence procedures\n",
            "4. Confirm both PHOG and PHTO as suitable alternates with current TAFs\n",
            "\n",
            "### Conditional Requirements:\n",
            "- If jet stream winds exceed 200 knots or CAT advisories upgrade to severe, reconsider routing via more southern Pacific tracks\n",
            "- Monitor fuel burn closely; if exceeding plan by >5% at coast-out, consider technical stop at KSFO or KLAX\n",
            "\n",
            "### Risk Acceptance Statement:\n",
            "The identified risks are within normal operational parameters for transpacific operations. The Boeing 787-9's advanced turbulence-dampening systems and excellent fuel efficiency provide adequate margins for the anticipated conditions. With proper mitigation strategies implemented, this flight can be conducted safely and efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "## 4. Additional Recommendations\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Crew Experience:** Ensure at least one pilot has recent Pacific crossing experience with CAT encounters\n",
            "2. **Passenger Communication:** Prepare cabin crew with clear PA announcements regarding expected turbulence\n",
            "3. **Medical Considerations:** Verify medical kit accessibility and crew medical training currency given extended overwater operation with turbulence potential\n",
            "4. **Post-flight:** File comprehensive PIREPs regarding actual CAT encounters and jet stream conditions for subsequent flights\n",
