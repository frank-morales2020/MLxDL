            "1. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and vinegar or lemon juice until the mixture becomes thick and emulsified. This should take about 5-7 minutes.\n",
            "2. Slowly pour the oil into the egg yolk mixture while continuously whisking. The mixture should start to thicken and emulsify as you add the oil.\n",
            "3. Continue whisking until the mixture becomes thick and creamy, and all of the oil has been incorporated. This can take up to 10-15 minutes.\n",
            "4. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may want to add more salt, pepper, or vinegar to taste.\n",
            "5. Transfer the mayonnaise to a jar or airtight container and store it in the fridge for up to 1 week.\n",

            "Here are some tips to help you make the best mayonnaise:\n",
            "* Use a neutral-tasting oil, such as canola or grapeseed, as it will not affect the flavor of the mayonnaise.\n",
            "* Use a high-quality egg yolk, as it will give the mayonnaise a richer and creamier texture.\n",
            "* Make sure the egg yolk is at room temperature before whisking, as this will help the mixture emulsify more easily.\n",
            "* Don't over-whisk the mayonnaise, as it can break and become too thick.\n",
