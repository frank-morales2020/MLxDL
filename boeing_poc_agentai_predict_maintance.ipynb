Although this is not above the 80% threshold that typically requires replacement, the fact that it is listed as a known issue suggests that there may be other factors at play causing the brakes to wear more quickly or perform suboptimally. Therefore, it would be prudent to conduct a thorough inspection and maintenance of the brake system to ensure safety and performance. All other components are within normal ranges and do not require immediate attention.\n",
