            "\n",
            "#### 3. Optimized Route  \n",
            "The route was optimized for efficiency, considering the preferred altitude (FL350), current weather, NOTAMs, and Boeing 787 performance characteristics (e.g., fuel efficiency at high altitudes, wind optimization).  \n",

            "- **Route String**: CYUL DCT WAYPT1 DCT WAYPT2 DCT CYVR  \n",
            "  - This is a direct route with two intermediate waypoints (WAYPT1 and WAYPT2) for navigation and optimization. (Waypoints are fictional in this simulation but represent standard high-altitude jet routes over Canada.)  \n",
            "- **Total Distance**: 2158 nautical miles (NM)  \n",
            "- **Estimated Flight Time**: 5.28 hours (approximately 5 hours and 17 minutes, assuming standard cruise speeds of ~Mach 0.85 for the Boeing 787, adjusted for winds).  \n",
            "- **Altitude Profile**: Cruise at FL350. Climb and descent profiles should follow standard procedures (e.g., initial climb to FL350 after departure, step descents approaching CYVR).  \n",
            "- **Optimization Notes**: The route avoids any potential weather or NOTAM impacts. Tailwinds at FL350 may reduce actual flight time; headwinds could increase it. Total great-circle distance without optimization would be similar, but this path accounts for efficient airspace usage.\n",

            "#### 4. Fuel Calculation  \n",
            "Fuel requirements were calculated based on the optimized route, aircraft type, distance, flight time, destination weather conditions, and wind. This includes reserves for taxi, climb, cruise, descent, holding (45 minutes), and contingency (e.g., diversion to alternate airport).  \n",

            "    - Factors Included: Partly cloudy conditions at CYVR with 15-knot winds, which may slightly increase fuel needs due to potential headwind or gusts on approach.  \n",
            "    - Reserves: Standard IFR reserves (e.g., 30 minutes holding + alternate fuel) are embedded in the calculation.  \n",
            "  - **Recommendations**: Load additional fuel if enroute weather worsens or for operational buffers. Boeing 787 max fuel capacity is ~126,000 kg, so this is well within limits.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Additional Recommendations  \n",
            "- **Alternates**: Consider CYYC (Calgary) or KSEA (Seattle) as alternates in case of issues at CYVR (e.g., low visibility).  \n",
            "- **Performance Notes**: The Boeing 787 is well-suited for this transcontinental flight at FL350, offering excellent range (up to 7,500+ NM) and efficiency. Monitor engine performance and ETOPS requirements over remote areas.  \n",
            "- **Safety and Compliance**: This is a planning tool output. File an official flight plan with ATC, obtain clearances, and perform a full pre-flight briefing. Check for updates to weather, NOTAMs, and airspace via official channels (e.g., NAV CANADA, FAA).  \n",
            "- **Estimated Departure Time**: Based on current time (15:46 EST), aim for a departure around 16:30-17:00 EST for optimal conditions, arriving CYVR around 17:00-18:00 PST (accounting for time zones and flight duration).  \n",
