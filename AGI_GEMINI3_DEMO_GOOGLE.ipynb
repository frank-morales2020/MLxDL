            "    *   Mechanical breakdown and removal of the fecaloma.\n",
            "    *   Direct visualization of the colonic mucosa to assess for ischemia or ulceration (stercoral ulcers).\n",
            "    *   Placement of a rectal tube to aid in ongoing decompression and irrigation.\n",
            "3.  **Surgical Consult:** A surgical team must be on standby. If endoscopy fails, or if there is evidence of full-thickness necrosis or frank perforation (pneumoperitoneum), an emergency Hartmann’s procedure (resection with colostomy) may be required.\n",
            "4.  **Supportive Care:** IV fluids for hydration, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and broad-spectrum antibiotics due to the risk of bacterial translocation across the compromised bowel wall.\n",

            "Once the acute phase resolves, the underlying etiology of the patient's severe constipation must be addressed to prevent recurrence:\n",
            "1.  **Functional Assessment:** The patient requires referral for **anorectal manometry** to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation (paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor during defecation), which is common in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders.\n",
            "2.  **Therapeutic Intervention:** Based on manometry findings, the patient should undergo **pelvic-floor physical therapy and biofeedback training** to retrain the defecation mechanism.\n",
            "3.  **Bowel Regimen:** Establishment of a rigorous maintenance bowel regimen (osmotic laxatives, scheduled toileting) is essential.\n"
