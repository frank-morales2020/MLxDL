Here’s a suggested itinerary for Bob, who is traveling from Vancouver (YVR) to San Antonio (SAT) with a 6-hour layover in Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW):\n> \n> ### 1. Arrival and Exit from DFW\n> - **Arrival Time**: Let’s assume Bob’s flight from YVR arrives at DFW at 11:00 AM.\n> - **Exit the Airport**: Bob should head to the DFW Terminal B or C, depending on his arrival gate, and proceed to exit the airport.\n> \n> ### 2. Transportation\n> - **DART Train**: The Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) is an affordable way to get around. A day pass costs around $10, which will cover his transportation needs.\n>   - **Time**: 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM (to get to the DART station and purchase a pass)\n> \n> ### 3. Activities\n> - **Option 1: Museum**\n>   - **Dallas Museum of Art**: Free admission, but some special exhibits may have a fee.\n>     - **Time**: 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM\n>     - **Transportation**: Take the DART to the Arts District Station.\n>   - **Option 2: Hiking**\n>     - **Trinity River Audubon Center**: Free admission, and it offers hiking trails.\n>       - **Time**: 12:30 PM - 2:30 PM\n>       - **Transportation**: Take the DART to the Audubon Station.\n> \n> ### 4.
