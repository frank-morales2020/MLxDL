The 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment was formed in November 1862 by Territorial Governor John Evans, composed mostly of members of the 1st Colorado Infantry Regiment and of C and D Companies of the 2nd Colorado Infantry Regiment. In November 1862, the unit was reorganized along with Companies C and D of the 2nd Colorado Infantry into the 1st Colorado Cavalry. The 2nd Regiment Colorado Cavalry was a cavalry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. == Service == The 2nd Colorado Cavalry was organized at St. Louis, Missouri, by consolidation of the 2nd Colorado Infantry and 3rd Colorado Infantry to date from October 1863 under the command of Colonel James Hobart Ford. The 3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment was a Union Army unit formed in the mid-1860s when increased traffic on the United States emigrant trails and settler encroachment resulted in numerous attacks against them by the Cheyenne and Arapaho. It was formed both to protect Colorado against incursions from the Confederate forces and to fight the Native Americans who already inhabited the area. The unit has since been disbanded.http://www.firstcolorado.org/ ==See also== *List of Colorado Territory Civil War units * 157th Field Artillery Regiment (United States) ==References== ==External links== * Colorado.gov website on the regiment Category:Units and formations of the Union Army from Colorado Category:Military units and formations in Colorado Category:1861 establishments in Colorado Territory Category:Military units and formations established in 1861 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1862 The 2nd Colorado Cavalry mustered out of service at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on September 23, 1865. == Detailed service == The regiment was organized at Benton Barracks, Missouri, until January 1863. The 1st Cavalry Regiment is a United States Army regiment that has its antecedents in the early 19th century in the formation of the United States Regiment of Dragoons. The Second Colorado Cavalry: A Civil War Regiment on the Great Plains (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press), 2020. Because the Native Americans believed the Cheyenne had been targeted by the US, major Sioux and Arapaho bands allied with them from 1865 on to attack the Vehos (whites) and try to drive emigrant settlers out of their lands. ==See also== *List of Colorado Territory Civil War units ==References== ;Bibliography *Hoig, Stan, The Sand Creek Massacre (Univ of Oklahoma Press, 1961).

The Parthe originates in northern Saxony, between Colditz and Bad Lausick. It flows northwest through Parthenstein, Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha before entering the city of Leipzig. By the time the Parthe reaches Leipzig the stony river bed is visible. == Name == Amongst others, the region Parthenstein and the motorway junction Parthenaue (the merging of the A 38 into the A 14 motorway) are called after the river. == Flooding 2002 == During the 100-year flood of the Elbe in 2002, the Parthe also broke its banks. The Parthe joins the White Elster in northwestern Leipzig. == Course == On its course through the Leipzig Bay (Leipziger Tieflandsbucht), the Parthe flows through the regions and towns of Gro\\u00dfbardau, Parthenstein, Naunhof, Beucha, Borsdorf, Panitzsch, Taucha and Leipzig. It is part of network of cycling routes, which run from Leipzig to the Freiberger Mulde as well as to the river Elbe. It originates from the D\\u00fcmmer, specifically its northern side near the Lembruch district of Eickh\\u00f6pen (in the joint municipality Altes Amt Lemf\\u00f6rde), then flows in a northerly direction west of Federal Highway 51 and occasionally - in the Graftlage area - directly alongside it. In Taucha and (a district of Leipzig) the Parthe flows through parks. This led to damage in villages and towns such as Kleinbardau and Gro\\u00dfbardau. == Recreation and Nature == The long Parthe-Mulde- cycling route from Grimma via Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha to Leipzig runs alongside the Parthe for long stretches. \",\n          \"It was the home of Terence V.

A hematinic is a nutrient required for the formation of blood cells in the process of hematopoiesis. Leukopoiesis is a form of hematopoiesis in which white blood cells (WBC, or leukocytes) are formed in bone marrow located in bones in adults and hematopoietic organs in the fetus. As a feeding practice, hematophagy has evolved independently in a number of arthropod, annelid, nematode and mammalian taxa. Hematophagy (sometimes spelled haematophagy or hematophagia) is the practice by certain animals of feeding on blood (from the Greek words \\u03b1\\u1f37\\u03bc\\u03b1 \\\"blood\\\" and \\u03c6\\u03b1\\u03b3\\u03b5\\u1fd6\\u03bd \\\"to eat\\\"). Since blood is a fluid tissue rich in nutritious proteins and lipids that can be taken without great effort, hematophagy is a preferred form of feeding for many small animals, such as worms and arthropods. Facultative hematophages, meanwhile, acquire at least some portion of their nutrition from non-blood sources in at least one of the sexually mature forms. Retrieved 2022-03-15 from https://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/myelopoiesis In a narrower sense, myelopoiesis also refers specifically to the regulated formation of myeloid leukocytes (myelocytes), including eosinophilic granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes, and monocytes. The common myeloid progenitor can differentiate in the bone marrow into red blood cells and megakaryocytes (leading to platelets) as well as mast cells and myeloblasts, the latter leading to the myelocytic line (granulocytes) and to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. Insects and arachnids of medical importance for being hematophagous, at least in some species, include the sandfly, blackfly, tsetse fly, bedbug, assassin bug, mosquito, tick, louse, mite, midge, and flea. Hematophagy in insects, including mosquitoes, is thought to have arisen from phytophagous or entomophagous origins. These immediate cell lines, or colonies, are progenitors of red blood cells (erythrocytes), platelets (megakaryocytes), and the two main groups of WBCs, myelocytes and lymphocytes. ==See also== * Lymphopoiesis * Myelopoiesis ==References== * Category:Hematopoiesis To overcome natural hemostasis (blood coagulation), vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pain sensation in the host, hematophagous animals have evolved chemical solutions, in their saliva for instance, that they pre- inject\\u2014and anesthesia and capillary dilation have evolved in some hematophagous species. The spider Evarcha culicivora feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by specializing on blood-filled female mosquitoes as their preferred prey.Evarcha culicivora chooses blood-fed Anopheles mosquitoes but other East African jumping spiders do not Some fish, such as lampreys and candirus; mammals, especially vampire bats; and birds, including the vampire finch, Hood mockingbird, Tristan thrush, and oxpeckers, also practise hematophagy. ==Mechanism and evolution== These hematophagous animals have mouth parts and chemical agents for penetrating vascular structures in the skin of hosts, mostly of mammals, birds, and fish. Monocytes eventually enter the tissues and become macrophages. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hematopoiesis Category:Histology In anautogenous species, the female can survive without blood but must consume blood in order to produce eggs (obligatory hematophages are by definition also anautogenous). Fly species such as Leptoconops torrens can also be facultative hematophages. Some intestinal nematodes, such as Ancylostomatids, feed on blood extracted from the capillaries of the gut, and about 75 percent of all species of leeches (e.g., Hirudo medicinalis) are hematophagous. Hematophagy is classified as either obligatory or facultative. In this process it first transforms from a common myeloblast (myeloid progenitor) to a common promyelocyte. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"A\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Elbe\",\n          \"Terence V Powderly was primarily known for his involvement in the establishment of the Terence V Powderly House, a historic house located in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\",\n          \"In the bone marrow\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"B\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Schwienau\",\n          \"Terence V Powderly was primarily known for his contributions to the field of probability theory and his development of the Liouville density.\",\n          \"In the circulation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"C\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Rhine\",\n          \"Terence V Powderly was primarily known for his prominent role in shaping the Quasiprobability Distribution Theory.\",\n          \"In the aorta\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"D\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Danube\",\n          \"Terence V Powderly was primarily known for his role as a labor leader and his leadership of the Knights of Labor, an early but unsuccessful attempt to establish a broad-based labor union.\",\n          \"In the embryo\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"E\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Weser\",\n          \"Terence V Powderly was primarily known for his successful political career as the mayor of Scranton for several terms.\",\n          \"In the mesoderm\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"B\",\n          \"D\",\n          \"E\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 8,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          5,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"more_context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Geberbach is a small river of Saxony, Germany.

The Parthe originates in northern Saxony, between Colditz and Bad Lausick. It flows northwest through Parthenstein, Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha before entering the city of Leipzig. By the time the Parthe reaches Leipzig the stony river bed is visible. == Name == Amongst others, the region Parthenstein and the motorway junction Parthenaue (the merging of the A 38 into the A 14 motorway) are called after the river. == Flooding 2002 == During the 100-year flood of the Elbe in 2002, the Parthe also broke its banks. The Parthe joins the White Elster in northwestern Leipzig. == Course == On its course through the Leipzig Bay (Leipziger Tieflandsbucht), the Parthe flows through the regions and towns of Gro\\u00dfbardau, Parthenstein, Naunhof, Beucha, Borsdorf, Panitzsch, Taucha and Leipzig. It is part of network of cycling routes, which run from Leipzig to the Freiberger Mulde as well as to the river Elbe. It originates from the D\\u00fcmmer, specifically its northern side near the Lembruch district of Eickh\\u00f6pen (in the joint municipality Altes Amt Lemf\\u00f6rde), then flows in a northerly direction west of Federal Highway 51 and occasionally - in the Graftlage area - directly alongside it. In Taucha and (a district of Leipzig) the Parthe flows through parks. This led to damage in villages and towns such as Kleinbardau and Gro\\u00dfbardau. == Recreation and Nature == The long Parthe-Mulde- cycling route from Grimma via Naunhof, Borsdorf and Taucha to Leipzig runs alongside the Parthe for long stretches. \",\n          \"It was the home of Terence V.

A hematinic is a nutrient required for the formation of blood cells in the process of hematopoiesis. Leukopoiesis is a form of hematopoiesis in which white blood cells (WBC, or leukocytes) are formed in bone marrow located in bones in adults and hematopoietic organs in the fetus. As a feeding practice, hematophagy has evolved independently in a number of arthropod, annelid, nematode and mammalian taxa. Hematophagy (sometimes spelled haematophagy or hematophagia) is the practice by certain animals of feeding on blood (from the Greek words \\u03b1\\u1f37\\u03bc\\u03b1 \\\"blood\\\" and \\u03c6\\u03b1\\u03b3\\u03b5\\u1fd6\\u03bd \\\"to eat\\\"). Since blood is a fluid tissue rich in nutritious proteins and lipids that can be taken without great effort, hematophagy is a preferred form of feeding for many small animals, such as worms and arthropods. Facultative hematophages, meanwhile, acquire at least some portion of their nutrition from non-blood sources in at least one of the sexually mature forms. Retrieved 2022-03-15 from https://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/myelopoiesis In a narrower sense, myelopoiesis also refers specifically to the regulated formation of myeloid leukocytes (myelocytes), including eosinophilic granulocytes, basophilic granulocytes, neutrophilic granulocytes, and monocytes. The common myeloid progenitor can differentiate in the bone marrow into red blood cells and megakaryocytes (leading to platelets) as well as mast cells and myeloblasts, the latter leading to the myelocytic line (granulocytes) and to monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells of the innate immune system. Insects and arachnids of medical importance for being hematophagous, at least in some species, include the sandfly, blackfly, tsetse fly, bedbug, assassin bug, mosquito, tick, louse, mite, midge, and flea. Hematophagy in insects, including mosquitoes, is thought to have arisen from phytophagous or entomophagous origins. These immediate cell lines, or colonies, are progenitors of red blood cells (erythrocytes), platelets (megakaryocytes), and the two main groups of WBCs, myelocytes and lymphocytes. ==See also== * Lymphopoiesis * Myelopoiesis ==References== * Category:Hematopoiesis To overcome natural hemostasis (blood coagulation), vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pain sensation in the host, hematophagous animals have evolved chemical solutions, in their saliva for instance, that they pre- inject\\u2014and anesthesia and capillary dilation have evolved in some hematophagous species. The spider Evarcha culicivora feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by specializing on blood-filled female mosquitoes as their preferred prey.Evarcha culicivora chooses blood-fed Anopheles mosquitoes but other East African jumping spiders do not Some fish, such as lampreys and candirus; mammals, especially vampire bats; and birds, including the vampire finch, Hood mockingbird, Tristan thrush, and oxpeckers, also practise hematophagy. ==Mechanism and evolution== These hematophagous animals have mouth parts and chemical agents for penetrating vascular structures in the skin of hosts, mostly of mammals, birds, and fish. Monocytes eventually enter the tissues and become macrophages. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hematopoiesis Category:Histology In anautogenous species, the female can survive without blood but must consume blood in order to produce eggs (obligatory hematophages are by definition also anautogenous). Fly species such as Leptoconops torrens can also be facultative hematophages. Some intestinal nematodes, such as Ancylostomatids, feed on blood extracted from the capillaries of the gut, and about 75 percent of all species of leeches (e.g., Hirudo medicinalis) are hematophagous. Hematophagy is classified as either obligatory or facultative. In this process it first transforms from a common myeloblast (myeloid progenitor) to a common promyelocyte. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
