In **ARC-AGI-2 (2025)**, these are specifically designed to be \"easy for humans, but hard for AI\" by focusing on **Core Knowledge Priors**—concepts like symmetry, object persistence, and counting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an explanation of the specific logic required for each Task ID in your log:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "### 1. Task `6e453dd6.json`\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Logic:** **Symmetry and Mirroring.**\n",
        "* **The Goal:** You are typically presented with a partial pattern (usually a half-completed shape or a grid with \"anchor points\"). The goal is to reflect or mirror a specific colored shape across a central axis to create a perfectly symmetrical output.\n",
        "* **Why it was ✅ ORBIT:** This is a \"global rule\" task. GPT-5.2 is excellent at identifying spatial symmetry. Once it realizes the rule is `output = flip_horizontal(input)`, the Python code it generates is simple and robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Task `dfadab01.json`\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Logic:** **Symbolic Interpretation.**\n",
        "* **The Goal:** This task is tricky because colors aren't just colors; they represent **semantic meanings**. For example, a blue pixel might mean \"move up,\" while a red pixel might mean \"stop.\" You have to treat the grid like a set of instructions rather than a picture.\n",
        "* **Why it was ❌ FAIL:** LLMs often struggle with assigning *meaning* to symbols. The model likely tried to use visual symmetry (like Task 1) instead of realizing that the colored pixels were actually \"control signals\" for a movement rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Task `58f5dbd5.json`\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Logic:** **Object Relocation (Gravity/Alignment).**\n",
        "* **The Goal:** You see several scattered shapes (objects) of different colors. The rule is usually to \"collapse\" or align them toward a specific edge (like pulling them down with gravity) or to a specific \"target\" shape.\n",
        "* **Why it was ✅ ORBIT:** This follows a clear geometric transformation. GPT-5.2 can easily write a loop in Python that says: `for object in grid: move_down_until_blocked(object)`. This is a very clean algorithmic problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Task `53fb4810.json`\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Logic:** **Contextual Rule Application (Counting Wall).**\n",
        "* **The Goal:** The rule changes based on how many objects are present. For example: \"If there are 3 blue squares, rotate them; if there are 4, delete them.\" It requires the AI to count precisely and then branching logic (`if/else`).\n",
        "* **Why it was ❌ FAIL:** This is known as the \"Counting Wall.\" AI often miscounts pixels in a grid or fails to generalize the count from the small training grids to the larger test grid. This leads to a \"Re-entry Burn.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Task `cbebaa4b.json`\n",
        "\n",
        "* **The Logic:** **Compositional Reasoning (The Boss Level).**\n",
        "* **The Goal:** This is a multi-step puzzle. You must (1) identify a colored cluster, (2) find its geometric center, and (3) grow a new pattern outward from that center based on the *color* of a separate reference pixel.\n",
        "* **The Challenge:** It requires simultaneous application of 3+ rules. If the AI gets Step 2 slightly wrong, Step 3 will fail completely.\n",
