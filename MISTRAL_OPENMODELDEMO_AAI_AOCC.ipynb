        "Agentic AI refers to AI systems designed to operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions to achieve specific goals with limited or no human supervision. Unlike traditional AI, which often operates within predefined rules and requires human input, agentic AI exhibits autonomy, goal-driven behavior, and adaptability. These systems utilize AI agents, which are machine learning models that mimic human decision-making to solve problems in real-time."

            "\n",
            "1. Overcast Sky: The overcast sky will limit visibility and may result in reduced contrast between the runway and the surrounding environment. This may necessitate the use of instrument approaches and departures. Pilots should be prepared for reduced visual cues and increased reliance on instrument indications during takeoff and initial climb.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Temperature: At 5°C, the temperature is above freezing, which means that no icing conditions are present. However, pilots should still be mindful of potential icing conditions at higher altitudes and ensure that anti-icing and de-icing procedures are followed as necessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Winds: The current wind conditions of 18 knots from the northeast may have several operational implications. Firstly, this wind speed is within the normal operational limits for most aircraft, but pilots should consider the impact of the wind on their takeoff performance, including required takeoff distances and climb gradients. Secondly, the crosswind component from the northeast may require pilots to use crosswind takeoff and landing techniques, such as crabbing or wing-low methods, to maintain runway alignment during takeoff.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Precipitation: If precipitation is forecasted, pilots should be prepared for reduced visibility and slippery runway conditions. This may necessitate the use of reduced takeoff and climb performance data and could impact aircraft handling and braking performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Low Ceilings: If low ceilings are forecasted, pilots should be prepared for potential IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) operations. This may require pilots to use instrument approaches and departures, which may impact takeoff and climb performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Wind Changes: If significant wind changes are forecasted, pilots should be prepared for potential crosswind takeoff and landing conditions. This may impact aircraft handling and performance during takeoff and initial climb.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Thunderstorms: If thunderstorms are forecasted, pilots should be prepared for potential turbulence, lightning, and other hazardous weather conditions. This may impact aircraft handling, performance, and passenger comfort during takeoff and initial climb.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, the current weather conditions at YUL present some operational implications for takeoff and initial climb, including reduced visibility, potential crosswinds, and the need for instrument approaches and departures. Pilots should be prepared for these conditions and adapt their procedures accordingly. Additionally, pilots should monitor forecasted weather conditions and be prepared to adjust their operations as necessary.\n",

However, air traffic control may assign a different runway based on traffic flow and other considerations. Pilots should be prepared for a crosswind component if a runway with a different alignment is used.\n",
            "- Potential hazards: While the current conditions do not pose significant hazards, pilots should still be vigilant for changing weather conditions and monitor for any updates from air traffic control or meteorological services. Additionally, if the cloud cover increases, it could potentially impact instrument approaches, and pilots should be prepared to fly an alternate approach or divert if necessary.\n",

This can be done by cross-referencing the crew roster with the flight schedule to determine who is available and qualified to operate the flight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Duty Time Limitations:\n",
            "For the Boeing 777, the maximum flight duty period (FDP) without a rest break is 13 hours, as per International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations. Given that the estimated flight time is 12.83 hours, the crew will likely be operating at the maximum duty time. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the crew has adequate rest before and after the flight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rest Requirements:\n",
            "For this type of flight, the crew must have a pre-flight rest period of at least 24 consecutive hours in the 72 hours before the flight, as per ICAO regulations. Additionally, the crew must have a post-flight rest period of at least 30 consecutive hours upon arrival at the destination. This is to ensure that the crew is well-rested and able to operate the aircraft safely.\n",
            "\n",
            "Optimal Crew Pairings:\n",
            "Given the long-haul nature of the flight, it is recommended to have at least four pilots on board: two captains and two first officers. This will allow for adequate crew rest during the flight and ensure that there are always two pilots in the cockpit who are fully rested and alert.\n",
            "\n",
            "For the cabin crew, the optimal number will depend on the configuration of the aircraft and the number of passengers. However, it is recommended to have at least one senior cabin crew member and several junior crew members to ensure that there are enough crew members to provide adequate service and respond to emergencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, it is important to ensure that the crew is well-rested and able to operate the aircraft safely. This can be achieved by adhering to duty time limitations, providing adequate rest periods, and optimizing crew pairings. By doing so, we can ensure that the flight operates smoothly and safely, and that the passengers have a positive experience.\n",
