            "1. **Soft Cheeses**:\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Semi-Soft Cheeses**:\n",
            "   - **Morbier**: Known for its distinctive layer of ash in the middle, it has a mild, nutty flavor.\n",
            "   - **Reblochon**: A savory cheese from the Alps, often used in the dish Tartiflette.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Hard Cheeses**:\n",
            "   - **Comté**: A popular choice with a complex, nutty flavor that varies based on age.\n",
            "   - **Beaufort**: Similar to Comté, it has a strong, slightly sweet flavor.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Blue Cheeses**:\n",
            "   - **Roquefort**: A classic blue cheese made from sheep's milk, with a tangy, salty flavor.\n",
            "   - **Bleu d'Auvergne**: A milder blue cheese with a creamy, buttery texture.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Goat Cheeses**:\n",
            "   - **Chèvre**: A generic term for goat cheese, it comes in many forms and can be fresh, aged, or flavored.\n",
            "   - **Crottin de Chavignol**: A small, barrel-shaped goat cheese with a tangy flavor.\n",
