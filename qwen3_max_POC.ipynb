            "**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that exhibit **autonomous, goal-directed behavior**—acting as an \"agent\" that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific objectives without constant human oversight.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key characteristics of Agentic AI include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Autonomy**: The ability to operate independently, making decisions and taking actions based on its understanding of goals and context.\n",
            "2. **Goal-Orientedness**: Designed to pursue specific objectives or tasks, often breaking them down into subtasks and planning accordingly.\n",
            "3. **Reasoning and Planning**: Capable of strategic thinking—evaluating options, anticipating consequences, and adapting plans as needed.\n",
            "4. **Reactivity and Adaptability**: Responds to changes in the environment or new information by adjusting its behavior.\n",
            "5. **Proactivity**: Initiates actions to achieve goals rather than just reacting to inputs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Agentic AI goes beyond passive tools (like a basic chatbot that answers questions) to become an active participant that can **orchestrate workflows, make judgments, and interact dynamically** with other systems or humans.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Examples:\n",
            "- An AI that manages your entire work schedule by autonomously scheduling meetings, sending reminders, and re-prioritizing tasks based on deadlines.\n",
            "- A research assistant AI that formulates hypotheses, designs experiments (in simulation), analyzes results, and iterates—all toward answering a scientific question.\n",
            "- Autonomous agents in robotics or self-driving cars that navigate complex, unpredictable environments.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Why it matters:\n",
            "Agentic AI represents a shift toward more capable, versatile, and human-like AI systems that can handle complex, multi-step tasks—potentially transforming industries like healthcare, logistics, software development, and scientific discovery.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, it also raises important considerations around **safety, alignment, transparency, and control**, since more autonomous systems may behave in unexpected or unintended ways.\n"

The function must explicitly check the condition where both B and C fail.\n",
