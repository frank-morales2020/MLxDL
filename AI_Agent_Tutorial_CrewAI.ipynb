        "CrewAI Demonstration Explanation\n",
        "This CrewAI implementation addresses the five points from your \"Building AI Agents From Scratch\" series:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What AI Agents Are:\n",
        "In CrewAI, agents are instantiated using the Agent class. Each agent is given a role, a goal, and a backstory. These attributes collectively define the agent's persona and purpose, guiding its decision-making and interaction within the crew. For instance, our InformationGatherer agent is designed specifically for factual data retrieval, while the CreativeContentCreator focuses on narrative generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How Tool Usage in AI Agents Actually Works:\n",
        "CrewAI seamlessly integrates standard Python functions as tools. You simply define a function (e.g., get_current_weather, get_stock_price, create_story) and then pass it directly into the tools list when initializing an Agent. The underlying LLM (like Gemini) is then responsible for understanding the tool's purpose (from its docstring) and parameters (from its signature) and deciding when and how to call it. The print statements within each tool function clearly show when a tool is being invoked by the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How to Build a Decorator Wrapper that Extracts Relevant Details from a Python Function:\n",
        "CrewAI simplifies tool definition. Instead of a custom decorator to extract function details, CrewAI's Agent class expects callable functions directly. The framework and the LLM handle the interpretation of the function's docstring and signature for tool description and parameter schema. This abstracts away the need for a manual decorator wrapper, as the LLM's capabilities are leveraged to understand the function's utility.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. How to Think About Constructing Effective System Prompts:\n",
        "CrewAI excels here by allowing you to define the agent's \"system prompt\" through its role, goal, and backstory parameters. These descriptive fields implicitly form a comprehensive prompt that guides the LLM attached to the agent. For example, the InformationGatherer's backstory tells the LLM that this agent is \"diligent and precise\" and \"excellent at understanding user queries and identifying the correct tool.\" Tasks also include a description that further refines the specific objective for the agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How to Build an Agent Class That is Able to Plan and Execute Actions Using Provided Tools:\n",
        "CrewAI provides the Crew class for orchestrating agents and their tasks. You define Task objects, assigning them to specific agents. The crew.kickoff() method initiates the process, where the agents, guided by their roles and the task descriptions, \"plan\" (their internal LLM reasoning) and \"execute\" by calling the appropriate tools. The verbose=2 setting in both Agent and Crew helps you observe this planning and execution flow in detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "This demonstration provides a robust framework for building more complex AI agents, directly transferable to our flight planning AI agent project, where different agents could handle weather, air traffic control regulations, route optimization, and passenger communications.\n",

The ground trembled with each of the dragon's breaths, but the knight stood unwavering, his shield raised high. Memories of his kingdom's suffering fueled his resolveâ€”burned villages, stolen treasures, and his king's dying command. As embers floated like fiery snowflakes, the dragon emerged, scales blacker than midnight, eyes like molten gold. \"You dare challenge me, mortal?\" it roared, shaking the mountains. The knight replied, \"For honor and the innocent!\" With a battle cry that echoed through the valley, he charged, sword arcing like a silver comet. Steel met scale in a shower of sparks, and though the dragon's flames licked at his armor, the knight fought with the strength of a hundred warriors. In the end, it was not brute force but cunning that won the dayâ€”he plunged his blade into a single loose scale over the beast's heart, just as his father had taught him. As the dragon fell, a cheer rose from the nearby village, freed at last. The knight returned home not just as a warrior, but as a legend whose tale would be sung for generations.\n",
