            "First, maybe I should mention that entangled particles are in a superposition of states. So, when you measure one, the other's state is instantly determined, no matter the distance. Wait, but how does that work? Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance,\" which he didn't like. But I think that's been proven through experiments, like Bell's theorem. \n",

If you measure the spin of one, the other's spin is instantly known, even if they're light-years apart. But it's not that information is transmitted faster than light, right?

            "Also, I should mention that entanglement is a key resource for quantum computing and quantum communication. But maybe that's for later. Let me structure this: start with the definition, then how it works, the EPR paradox and Bell's theorem, and then the implications or applications. \n",
            "\n",
            "I need to make sure not to mix up quantum superposition with entanglement. Superposition is when a particle exists in multiple states at once. Entanglement is when two or more particles are correlated in such a way that the state of one affects the other. \n",

            "Flight plans must comply with regulations covering the following aspects:\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **A. Route Planning**\n",
            "- **Compliance with Airspace Regulations**: Routes must avoid restricted areas, prohibited zones, and ensure separation from other aircraft (e.g., under ICAO’s *Air Traffic Services* rules).\n",
            "- **Navigation Aids**: Use of GPS, VOR, NDB, or other approved navigation systems as required by the airspace.\n",
            "- **Airway Designation**: Routes must follow designated airways (e.g., RNAV routes, ATS routes) and adhere to altitude and speed restrictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **B. Fuel Requirements**\n",
            "- **Minimum Fuel Requirements**: \n",
            "  - **U.S.**: 14 CFR Part 91.165 requires a **minimum fuel** reserve to reach an alternate airport or divert to a suitable airport if required.\n",
            "  - **EASA**: Similar requirements under Part-OPS, including **contingency fuel** (e.g., 5% of trip fuel).\n",
            "- **Fuel Calculation**: Must account for weather, route length, aircraft performance, and potential delays.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **C. Weather and Meteorological Considerations**\n",
            "- **Weather Briefings**: Pilots must obtain and review **SIGMETs**, **PIREPs**, and **NOTAMs** (Notices to Airmen) for weather conditions.\n",
            "- **Minimum Weather Standards**: Compliance with **VIS (Visibility)** and **Ceiling** requirements for takeoff, landing, and en route operations (e.g., ICAO’s **Minimum En Route Altitude**).\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **D. Alternate Airports and Diversion**\n",
            "- **Alternate Airport Requirements**: \n",
            "  - **U.S.**: Part 91.165 mandates an alternate airport if the primary destination is not suitable for an emergency landing.\n",
            "  - **EASA**: Part-OPS requires an alternate airport for certain operations, especially for international flights.\n",
            "- **Diversion Planning**: Fuel and route must allow for diversion to an alternate airport in case of emergencies.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **E. Communication and Navigation**\n",
            "- **ATC Communication**: Flight plans must include contact details for Air Traffic Control (ATC) and comply with **IFR (Instrument Flight Rules)** or **VFR (Visual Flight Rules)** requirements.\n",
            "- **Emergency Procedures**: Include details for emergency equipment, transponder codes, and communication protocols.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### **F. Flight Plan Submission**\n",
            "- **FPL (Flight Plan)**: A formal document submitted to ATC, containing:\n",

            "Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step. The user wants to plan a flight from Montreal (CYUL) to New York (KJFK) for tomorrow morning, which they specified as July 22, 2025 at 08:00 EST. They're using a Cessna 172 and need to know the fuel required.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I need to check if the tools provided can handle this. The user mentioned the departure and arrival airports, so I should use the calculate_route_distance tool to get the distance between CYUL and KJFK. Once I have the distance, I can use the estimate_fuel_burn_cessna172 tool to calculate the fuel needed. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, the user also mentioned the date and time. Do I need to check the weather for that specific time? The get_weather_forecast tool is available, but the user hasn't asked for weather conditions. They just want the fuel calculation. So maybe I can skip that unless there's a hidden need. But the question is straightforward about fuel, so probably not necessary here.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, the date given is July 22, 2025. The get_current_datetime tool can provide the current date and time, but the user already specified the date. However, since the flight is scheduled for a future date, maybe the weather forecast tool would need that date. But again, the user hasn't asked for weather. So maybe the date is only relevant for the fuel calculation if there's a wind component. Wait, the fuel calculation tool allows for an average wind component. But the user hasn't provided wind information. The question says to assume the date and time, but no wind. So maybe the average_wind_kts parameter is optional, and if not provided, it defaults to zero. \n",
            "\n",
            "So the steps are: calculate the distance between CYUL and KJFK using calculate_route_distance. Then use that distance in the fuel calculation tool. Since the user didn't mention wind, I'll omit the average_wind_kts parameter. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, the user said \"tomorrow morning\" which is July 22, 2025 at 08:00 EST. But the date is in the future. However, the get_current_datetime tool gives the current time, but the user already provided the date. So maybe I don't need to use that tool here. The date is already given, so the fuel calculation doesn't require the current date. \n",
            "\n",
            "So first, call calculate_route_distance with origin_airport_code CYUL and destination_airport_code KJFK. Then, take the distance from that response and plug it into estimate_fuel_burn_cessna172 with distance_nm and average_wind_kts (if needed). Since the user didn't mention wind, I'll assume average_wind_kts is zero or not provided. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, the parameters for estimate_fuel_burn_cessna172 require distance_nm as mandatory. The average_wind_kts is optional. So I can proceed with just the distance. \n",
            "\n",
            "Therefore, the first tool call is to calculate the distance between the two airports. Once I get that, I can calculate the fuel. The user's question is about fuel, so the answer depends on the distance. \n",
