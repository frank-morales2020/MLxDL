It covers fuel reserves, diversion airports, maintenance procedures, and crew training. The document specifies that for a Boeing 787, ETOPS 330 is typically approved, meaning it can fly up to 330 minutes from a suitable diversion airport. This includes considerations for single-engine performance and depressurization scenarios. The document also provides guidelines on how to calculate adequate fuel for different phases of flight, including contingency fuel, alternate fuel, and final reserve fuel. Furthermore, it outlines the necessary communication and navigation equipment for ETOPS flights, emphasizing redundancy. The procedures for pre-flight planning and in-flight monitoring are also extensively detailed, ensuring safety and compliance. The document also touches upon the importance of real-time weather monitoring for all potential diversion airports along the planned route. Any changes to the flight plan due to weather or operational issues must be immediately communicated to air traffic control and the airline's operations center. This ensures that all parties are aware of the current status and can provide necessary support.
