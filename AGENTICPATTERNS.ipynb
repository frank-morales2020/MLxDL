            "3.  **\"Proactively\" vs. \"Reactively\":** The distinction (\"do things proactively, not just respond to prompts\") is helpful but slightly imprecise. Many AI systems *react* to prompts. Agents are better described as continuously operating towards a goal, which might involve both reacting to environmental changes *and* initiating actions proactively based on their internal state and objectives.\n",
            "4.  **Scope of Examples:** The examples (self-driving cars, smart thermostats, game characters) are good and relatable, but they represent vastly different levels of complexity and autonomy. The response doesn't acknowledge this nuance. A thermostat's \"agency\" is far simpler than a self-driving car's.\n",

            "\n",
            "An AI agent is an **autonomous entity** that perceives its environment through **sensors** (or data inputs), makes decisions using an internal **decision-making mechanism** (like algorithms or models), and takes **actions** upon that environment using **actuators** (or outputs) to achieve specific **goals**.\n",

            "**Key Characteristics Explained:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Perception:** The agent gathers information about its current state and surroundings. This could be through physical sensors (cameras, thermometers, microphones) or data feeds (stock prices, user input, game state).\n",
            "2.  **Autonomy:** This means the agent can operate *independently* without direct human control for every single decision. It follows its programming or learned strategies to pursue its goals. The level of autonomy varies greatly – from a simple thermostat reacting to temperature to a complex self-driving car navigating traffic.\n",
            "3.  **Decision-Making:** Based on its perceptions, programming, and goals, the agent decides what action (or sequence of actions) is best to take next. This is the \"brain\" of the agent.\n",
            "4.  **Action:** The agent executes its decision, interacting with and potentially changing its environment. This could be adjusting a temperature, moving a robot arm, making a trade, steering a vehicle, or displaying information.\n",
            "5.  **Goal-Oriented:** Agents are designed with specific objectives. Their actions are purposeful and directed towards achieving these goals (e.g., maintain temperature, win a game, reach a destination safely, maximize profit). They often operate continuously over time to make progress towards these goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Think of it this way:** Unlike a simple calculator that only responds when you type something in, an AI agent often runs continuously, observing its world and deciding when and how to act to fulfill its purpose.\n",

            "**Examples (showing varying complexity):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Simple:** A **smart thermostat** (senses temperature, decides to heat/cool based on target goal, acts on the HVAC system).\n",
            "*   **Moderate:** A **robotic vacuum cleaner** (senses dirt/obstacles/layout, decides on a cleaning path, acts by moving and suctioning). **Game AI characters** (perceive player actions/environment, decide tactics based on goals like survival/attack, act within the game's rules).\n",
            "*   **Complex:** A **self-driving car** (perceives traffic, signs, roads via multiple sensors; makes complex driving decisions based on safety/navigation goals; acts on steering, braking, acceleration). **Sophisticated financial trading bots** (perceive market data streams, decide on trades based on profit goals/risk models, execute buy/sell orders).\n",

            "*   **Mount Royal Park:** Hike or take a bus up for panoramic city views. Enjoy the fall colours.\n",
            "*   **Museums:** Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (Downtown), Pointe-à-Callière, Montreal Archaeology and History Complex (Old Montreal).\n",
            "*   **Food Experiences:** Explore Jean-Talon or Atwater Markets (accessible by Metro). Try Montreal staples like bagels (St-Viateur, Fairmount), smoked meat (Schwartz's Deli), and poutine. Consider a food tour in the Plateau or Mile End neighbourhoods.\n",
            "*   **Underground City (RESO):** Explore parts of it, especially if the weather is poor. Connects shopping centres and Metro stations downtown.\n",
            "*   **Day Trip/Excursion:** Depending on pace, maybe a trip to the Olympic Park & Biodome (accessible by Metro).\n",
            "\n",
            "Once I have more details on interests and pace, I can create a more structured draft itinerary. For example, Saturday could be focused on settling in and exploring Old Montreal, Sunday could involve Mount Royal and a museum, etc.\n",
