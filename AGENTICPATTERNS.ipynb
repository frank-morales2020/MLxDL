            "    *   **Vagueness:** Terms like \"sense,\" \"make decisions,\" and \"take actions\" are correct but lack detail on *how* this happens in an AI context (e.g., using sensors/data, algorithms/models, actuators/outputs).\n",
            "    *   **\"On its own\":** This implies autonomy, which is key, but could be slightly clearer or expanded upon (e.g., operating without direct human intervention for every step).\n",
            "    *   **Lack of Examples:** Concrete examples make abstract concepts much easier to grasp. The initial response lacks these.\n",
