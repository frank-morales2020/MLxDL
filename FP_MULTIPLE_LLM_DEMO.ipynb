The user wants me to plan a flight from Montreal (Canada) to Shanghai (China) for a specific date (May 25th, 2025). They want a realistic plan, considering air traffic and weather, and they need a list of key waypoints.\\n\\nHere's my plan of action:\\n\\n1. **Gather Airport Information:**  I need ICAO codes for Montreal and Shanghai airports to use as origin and destination.  I'll look up common major airports serving Shanghai.\\n2. **Determine Date and Time:** I have the date (May 25th, 2025). I'll need to assume a departure time or ask the user for one to begin the planning process. I'll assume a departure time of 14:00 UTC to start.\\n3. **Route Generation:** I will use a flight planning algorithm/service to generate a realistic route between the two airports. This will involve:\\n    *   Considering the Great Circle route as a starting point but adjusting for airways, navigational aids, and potentially avoiding restricted airspace.\\n    *   Factoring in prevailing winds (jet streams) to optimize fuel efficiency.\\n    *   Considering typical air traffic patterns between North America and East Asia.\\n4. **Waypoint Extraction:**  From the generated route, I will extract key waypoints (significant intersections or VORs/NDBs) that define the route.\\n5. **Weather Analysis:** I'll use historical weather data (if available) for May 25th in the general areas along the route (North Atlantic, Siberia, China) to identify potential weather hazards (turbulence, icing, etc.). I'll also look for typical weather patterns for that time of year (e.g., monsoon season in China).\\n6. **Air Traffic Considerations:** I will research typical busy air routes and airspace congestion areas between North America and China for May. I will also consider potential flight restrictions or preferred routes.\\n7. **Presentation of Results:**  I will present the flight plan with:\\n    *   Departure and Arrival Airports (with ICAO codes)\\n    *   Departure Date and Time (UTC)\\n    *   Key Waypoints (with coordinates or identifiers)\\n    *   Estimated Flight Time\\n    *   Notes on Weather Considerations\\n    *   Notes on Air Traffic Considerations\\n    *   Disclaimer: Flight plans\", \"Retrieved: semantic_info_1_sdb\\nsemantic_info_2_sdb\\nWeb result for 'You are a helpful AI flight planning assistant.
