        "\n",
        "**In silico ADMET** refers to the use of computational (or \"silico\") methods to predict the **A**bsorption, **D**istribution, **M**etabolism, **E**xcretion, and **T**oxicity of chemical compounds, particularly drug candidates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **In silico:** This term means \"performed on computer or via computer simulation.\" It contrasts with *in vitro* (in a test tube) and *in vivo* (in a living organism).\n",
        "* **ADMET:** These are five crucial pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties that determine how a drug behaves in the body and its potential for harm:\n",
        "    * **Absorption:** How well a drug enters the bloodstream from its site of administration (e.g., gut, skin).\n",
        "    * **Distribution:** How the drug spreads throughout the body's tissues and organs once absorbed.\n",
        "    * **Metabolism:** How the body chemically modifies the drug, often breaking it down.\n",
        "    * **Excretion:** How the drug and its metabolites are eliminated from the body (e.g., via urine, feces).\n",
        "    * **Toxicity:** The potential for a drug to cause adverse effects or harm to the body.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose in Drug Discovery:**\n",
        "The primary goal of *in silico* ADMET prediction is to screen potential drug candidates early in the discovery process. By predicting these properties computationally, researchers can:\n",
        "* **Filter out undesirable compounds:** Identify molecules likely to have poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, unfavorable distribution, or significant toxicity *before* costly and time-consuming laboratory experiments or clinical trials.\n",
        "* **Prioritize promising candidates:** Focus resources on compounds with more favorable ADMET profiles.\n",
        "* **Guide molecular design:** Inform medicinal chemists on how to modify chemical structures to improve their ADMET properties.\n",
        "* **Reduce costs and accelerate timelines:** By minimizing late-stage failures due to ADMET issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Canvas code, the `predict_admet_tool` function simulates this process, providing mock predictions for various ADMET characteristics like \"Human Oral Bioavailability,\" \"Hepatotoxicity,\" and \"CYP2D6 Inhibition.\" While the actual predictions in the demo are random, they represent the types of outputs a real *in silico* ADMET model would generate."
