            "\n",
            "1.  **Acknowledge and Address the Specific Request (1850 Rainfall):**\n",
            "    *   State clearly that retrieving accurate, comprehensive, and digitally available \"average rainfall\" data for Paris specifically for the year 1850 is not feasible through standard aviation weather data sources or historical climate databases relevant for modern flight planning.\n",
            "    *   Explain that meteorological record-keeping in 1850 was rudimentary compared to today, making detailed, annual averages difficult or impossible to reconstruct reliably for operational purposes.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Crucially Explain the Irrelevance of 1850 Data for Modern Flight Planning:**\n",
            "    *   Emphasize that weather patterns and climate have changed considerably over the last 170+ years.\n",
            "    *   Clearly state that historical weather data from such a distant past holds no predictive value for current or future flight operations. Modern aviation safety and efficiency depend on current observations and short-term forecasts.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Educate on What Weather Information *Is* Relevant for Flight Planning:**\n",
            "    *   **Timeframe:** Explain that flight planning relies on real-time observations, short-range (0-24 hours) and medium-range (up to 7 days) forecasts, and recent climatological averages (e.g., 30-year averages for 1991-2020) for general route planning or seasonal considerations.\n",
            "    *   **Key Parameters:** List the essential weather parameters required for flight planning:\n",
            "        *   Wind speed and direction (surface and aloft)\n",
            "        *   Temperature (surface and aloft)\n",

            "        *   Cloud cover and ceiling\n",
            "        *   Precipitation type and intensity\n",
            "        *   Atmospheric pressure (for altimeter settings)\n",
            "        *   Significant weather phenomena (thunderstorms, turbulence, icing, fog, dust storms, volcanic ash).\n",
            "    *   **Data Sources (General):** Mention types of sources: METARs (current observations), TAFs (terminal forecasts), SIGMETs/AIRMETs (en-route significant weather), Winds Aloft Forecasts, Weather Charts (e.g., Significant Weather Charts, Convective Outlooks), NOTAMs (for weather-related operational impacts).\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Propose a Constructive Alternative/Clarification:**\n",
            "    *   Ask the user to specify the *actual* date, time, and specific airport(s) in Paris (e.g., Charles de Gaulle - LFPG, Orly - LFPO) for which they need weather information.\n",
            "    *   Explain that with this current/future information, a detailed and relevant flight weather briefing can be provided.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Outline the Process for Gathering *Relevant* Weather Data (assuming a current/future date is provided):**\n",
            "    *   **Identify Airport ICAO Codes:** Determine the specific airport(s) in Paris (e.g., LFPG, LFPO).\n",
            "    *   **Determine Flight Period:** Define the exact departure, en-route, and arrival times.\n",
            "    *   **Retrieve Real-time Observations:** Query for current METARs for the departure, destination, and alternate airports.\n",
            "    *   **Retrieve Terminal Forecasts:** Query for TAFs for the departure, destination, and alternate airports covering the flight window.\n",
            "    *   **Retrieve En-route Forecasts:**\n",
            "        *   Winds and Temperatures Aloft (using global models, e.g., GFS, based on flight altitude).\n",
            "        *   Significant Weather Charts (for potential turbulence, icing, thunderstorms, widespread precipitation along the route).\n",
            "        *   Upper Air Charts (Jet Stream, Pressure Systems).\n",
            "    *   **Retrieve Area Forecasts/SIGMETs/AIRMETs:** Check for any hazardous weather advisories along the planned route.\n",
            "    *   **Check NOTAMs:** Review for any weather-related operational restrictions (e.g., runway closures due to ice, reduced visibility procedures).\n",
            "    *   **Synthesize:** Compile all relevant data into a comprehensive weather brief for the specific flight.\n",
            "\n",
