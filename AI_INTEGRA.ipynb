You can choose to fly into any of New York's international airports - JFK, LaGuardia, or Newark. Consider booking a flight that would give you enough time to settle down and reach the stadium before the game starts.\n",

            "3. **Transport Details to Stadium**: The Yankee Stadium is located in the Bronx and is accessible via public transportation. The B, D, or 4 subway lines will get you directly to the Stadium at 161st Street Station.\n",

            "4. **Getting Yankees Game Tickets**: Visit the Yankees' official website for the schedule of games and to purchase tickets. Make sure to check the date and time of the game. It's best to buy tickets in advance as they can sell out.\n",
