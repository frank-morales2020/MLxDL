            "\n",
            "**1. Factor in Travel Time to and from Airport:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **DFW is HUGE:** Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) has five terminals.  Assume 30-45 minutes for a potential terminal change, even with the Skylink train. Factor in travel time to/from attractions in your plan.\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Transportation Options & Costs:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **DFW Airport Skylink:**  FREE and efficient for moving between terminals.\n",
            "* **DART Rail:** Connects to downtown Dallas. A round trip costs around $6.\n",
            "* **Taxis/Ride-Sharing:**  Most expensive, especially with surge pricing. Estimate around $30-40+ each way to downtown Dallas.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Prioritize Based on Interests and Budget:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Given Bob's interests and the 6-hour layover (minus travel time), a quick trip into Dallas is possible but will be rushed. Here are a few options:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Option 1: Stay at the Airport & Enjoy DFW**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Foodie Fun:** DFW has surprisingly good dining! Explore different terminals for Texas BBQ, Tex-Mex, or upscale options. \n",
            "* **Airport Adventures:** Check out the art installations, walking paths, and shops within the airport. Some terminals have yoga studios or mini-spas for relaxation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Option 2: Quick Trip to Downtown Dallas (Tight Schedule!)**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza:**  (History buff, about 1.5-2 hours). Allow ample travel time. \n",
            "* **Lunch at the Reunion Tower:** Scenic views and a revolving restaurant, but pricier.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Option 3: Focus on One Thing and Relax:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Choose ONE:** Either a museum visit *OR* a nice lunch in downtown Dallas. This reduces rushing.\n",
            "* **Airport Relaxation:** Spend the remaining time relaxing at the airport â€“ grab a drink, read a book, and recharge for the next flight. \n",
            "\n",
            "**Suggested Time:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **If staying at DFW:** No specific time constraints.\n",
            "* **If going to Dallas:** Aim to arrive downtown by 11:00 AM to give yourself 3-4 hours before heading back to the airport.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Budget Tips:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Pack Snacks:**  Bring your own snacks and a reusable water bottle to save on airport prices. \n",
            "* **Airport Food Court:**  Look for food court options at DFW, which tend to be cheaper than sit-down restaurants.\n",
            "* **Free Activities:**  Walking, people-watching, and enjoying the airport amenities won't cost a thing.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important:**  Monitor flight status for any delays and adjust your plan accordingly!  Have a great trip, Bob! \n",
