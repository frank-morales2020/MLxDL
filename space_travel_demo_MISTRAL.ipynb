            "Okay, I need to think about Cuban poets. I know that Cuba has a rich literary tradition, so there must be several prominent poets to consider.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I recall that José Martí is often mentioned in the context of Cuban literature. He's not just a poet but also a national hero and symbol of Cuba's struggle for independence. His works, like \"Versos sencillos,\" are well-known and highly regarded.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there's Nicolás Guillén, who is celebrated for his contributions to Afro-Cuban poetry. His work often explores themes of racial identity and social justice, which are significant in Cuban culture.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another name that comes to mind is Dulce María Loynaz. She won the Cervantes Prize, which is a prestigious award in the Spanish-speaking world. Her poetry is known for its lyrical beauty and emotional depth.\n",
            "\n",
            "But who is the best? That's a subjective question. It depends on what criteria we're using: influence, literary merit, cultural impact, etc. José Martí is often considered the national poet of Cuba, which might give him an edge in terms of cultural significance.\n",
            "\n",
            "But let's think about other prominent poets as well. There's also Gertrudis Gómez de Avellaneda, who was a significant figure in the 19th century. Her work is notable, but she might not be as widely recognized today.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then there's Virgilio Piñera, known for his avant-garde style and existential themes. His work is quite influential, but perhaps more in the realm of theater and prose.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that Martí is often referred to as the national poet and his works are deeply ingrained in Cuban culture, it's reasonable to consider him the best Cuban poet. However, it's important to note that \"best\" is subjective and others might prefer Guillén or Loynaz based on personal taste or specific criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "But for a general answer, especially considering cultural impact and historical significance, José Martí seems to be the most prominent figure.\n",
            "\n",
            "But just to be sure, I should think about other poets. What about Eliseo Diego? He was also a notable poet, but his recognition might not be as widespread as Martí's.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another name is Heberto Padilla, known for his controversial works during the Cuban Revolution.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Martí's influence extends beyond poetry into the realm of national identity and political thought, which makes him a strong candidate for the title of \"best\" Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But is it fair to call someone the \"best\"? Poetry is so subjective. Maybe it's better to list some of the most prominent ones and let the user decide. But the problem asks for the best, so perhaps Martí is the most widely accepted answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, I recall that Nicolás Guillén is often praised for his unique style and impact on Afro-Cuban identity. Maybe in terms of literary innovation, Guillén stands out.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a tough question. Maybe I should consider awards and international recognition. Dulce María Loynaz won the Cervantes Prize, which is a big deal in the Spanish-speaking world. That might make her a strong candidate.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Martí is often called the national poet, which is a significant title. Maybe he's the best-known and most celebrated.\n",
            "\n",
            "But is \"best\" about fame or about literary quality? It's a bit ambiguous. Maybe I should think about who is most studied and celebrated in literary circles.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking at academic and literary criticism, both Martí and Guillén are highly regarded. Martí for his role in Cuban independence and his literary contributions, and Guillén for his poetic innovation and cultural representation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps it's a tie between Martí and Guillén. But since the question asks for the best, and Martí is more of a national symbol, maybe he is the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for more information or think about other poets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, what about Reinaldo Arenas? He was a prominent poet and writer, known for his powerful and often controversial works. But he might be more famous for his novels than his poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is tricky. Maybe the best approach is to consider who is most commonly cited as the greatest Cuban poet in literary discussions and histories.\n",
            "\n",
            "From what I recall, José Martí is often placed at the forefront of Cuban literature. So perhaps he is the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to be thorough, I should consider that \"best\" can be subjective. Some might argue for Guillén or Loynaz based on different criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that, perhaps the most objective answer is to list the most prominent Cuban poets and acknowledge that deciding the \"best\" is subjective.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem asks for the best, so I need to choose one. Given Martí's status as a national hero and his significant contributions to poetry, he might be the most widely accepted answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But before finalizing, I recall that there's also a poet named Lezama Lima. José Lezama Lima was a major figure in Cuban literature, known for his complex and dense poetry. His work is highly regarded among literary critics.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, comparing Martí, Guillén, and Lezama Lima:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Martí: national hero, significant cultural impact, versatile writer.\n",
            "- Guillén: important for Afro-Cuban identity, innovative in style.\n",
            "- Lezama Lima: highly regarded by critics, complex and influential poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about specific works or impacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Martí's \"Versos sencillos\" is iconic, and his influence on Cuban identity is immense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Guillén's \"Motivos de son\" is also highly influential, especially in terms of racial and cultural identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lezama Lima's \"Paradiso\" is a monumental work, though more known as a novel than poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that, perhaps Martí and Guillén are the top contenders for the title of best Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But if I had to choose one, considering Martí's pervasive influence on Cuban culture and national identity, he might be considered the best.\n",
            "\n",
            "But again, it's subjective. To give a definitive answer, maybe I should go with Martí based on his overall impact and recognition.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, to be fair, I should mention that there are other significant poets, and \"best\" is a matter of opinion.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that the problem asks for the best Cuban poet, and considering Martí's prominent status, I'll go with José Martí as the best Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not entirely confident because I know that other poets like Guillén and Lezama Lima are also highly regarded.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maybe the best approach is to say that José Martí is widely considered one of the greatest Cuban poets due to his significant contributions to literature and national identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "But is he the best? I'm not sure. Maybe the most famous and influential, but \"best\" is subjective.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps the user is looking for a name, and Martí is a safe bet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to be more accurate, perhaps the answer should be that it's subjective, but José Martí is often regarded as the greatest.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem asks for the best, implying a single answer. So I'll go with José Martí.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm still not sure. Maybe I should think about literary awards and recognition.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dulce María Loynaz won the Cervantes Prize, which is a major literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. That might make her the \"best\" by some standards.\n",
            "\n",
            "But Martí is more of a cultural icon. Guillén is also highly respected.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is challenging. Maybe the best way is to list the top poets and let the user decide.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the problem asks for the best, so perhaps the most recognized globally would be José Martí.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think I'll go with José Martí as the best Cuban poet, recognizing that others like Guillén, Lezama Lima, and Loynaz are also major figures in Cuban poetry.\n",
            "\n",
            "But before finalizing, I recall that there's a poet named Virgilio Piñera. He's also significant but perhaps more known for his plays and stories.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay, after considering several names, José Martí seems to be the most prominent figure in Cuban poetry, both for his literary contributions and his role in Cuban history. So, I'll conclude that José Martí is the best Cuban poet.\n",
            "\n",
            "But to be thorough, I should mention that this is subjective and others might have different opinions based on different criteria.\n",
