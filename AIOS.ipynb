            "[MathAgent] The solution to step 2: To solve the sub-problems in step 2, we apply simple multiplication and addition. 1. For large pizzas, multiply the number of large pizzas by the number of slices per large pizza. In this case, 2 large pizzas * 16 slices = 32 slices.2. For small pizzas, multiply the number of small pizzas by the number of slices per small pizza. In this case, 2 small pizzas * 8 slices = 16 slices.\n",
