A deeply honorable man, Emeric has vowed to seize the hidden treasure for the wellbeing of his impoverished kingdom.2. Morwen - A mystical seer who resides in the Whispering Woods.

He places great faith in Sir Emeric, seeing him as the realm's last hope.4. Seraphim - A malevolent sorcerer who guards the treasure on the mystical island Silmaris.

            "[MathAgent] The solution to step 2: To solve the sub-problems in step 2, we apply simple multiplication and addition. 1. For large pizzas, multiply the number of large pizzas by the number of slices per large pizza. In this case, 2 large pizzas * 16 slices = 32 slices.2. For small pizzas, multiply the number of small pizzas by the number of slices per small pizza. In this case, 2 small pizzas * 8 slices = 16 slices.\n",
