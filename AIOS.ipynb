Thregoria's sea-bounded boundaries enclose dense forests, high mountains, undulating valleys, and sprawling meadows. Amidst this expansive kingdom lies Mystis Isle, a mystical island veiled in secrecy and filled with whispers of hidden treasures.In the bustling town of Brenningrad, at the heart of Thregoria, dwells our protagonist - a valiant and tenacious warrior named Thoren. Raised amidst the swords and shields, Thoren was a force of nature, well-known for his bravery, strategy, and strong moral compass.Our character Thoren wasn't just a remarkable warrior; he was also a treasure hunter, intrigued by mystic artifacts. From ancient ruins to forgot places, his quests had led him to the farthest corners of Thregoria, back to the mysterious kingdom his family called home. An unquenchable thirst for adventure burned within Thoren's heart, driving him to seek out the undiscovered. His latest fascination was the once-thriving civilization on Mystis Isle, known for its priceless treasures hidden somewhere within its untamed wilderness. With his sturdy physique, astute mind, and an old, cryptic map he'd recently acquired, Thoren determinedly set his sights towards the enigmatic Mystis Isle. And thus begins our tale of bravery and discovery.\n",

In this case, that's 2 * 16 = 32 slices.2.

The old, cryptic map was a companion, guiding him through the perilous pathways towards Mystis Isle. The early parts of his voyage were slow and tiresome, testing his resolve. But, his indomitable spirit refused to yield, propelling him towards the promised adventure.Eventually, Thoren made landfall on Mystis Isle. Its virginal beauty was overwhelming. The island was dominated by dense, overgrown forests and interwoven by crystal clear streams. Intricate stone carvings, remnants of a forgotten civilization, peeked from beneath the wilderness. But his journey had just begun. For deep within the island's heart lay the enchanted cavern, home to the hidden treasures, or so the tales went.Relying on his honed survival skills and the map's cryptic instructions, Thoren navigated the sprawling forest. After several days of struggle and tenacity, he discovered the entrance of the mystical cavern overgrown with vines, hidden at the base of a towering waterfall.Thrilled with his discovery, Thoren proceeded into the cavern. The climax reached when, in the cavern’s echoing vastness, he stumbled upon a colossal stone dragon, an ancient guardian protecting the hidden treasures. To proceed, Thoren had to challenge the dragon in a battle. With unyielding bravery, Thoren stood his ground, his warrior instincts awakening. The cavern echoed with roars and clashing of swords. It was a test of wit and prowess. Ultimately Thoren managed to outmaneuver the ancient guardian and landed the knockout blow. The defeated dragon crumbled and revealed a hidden door behind it, leading to the treasure vault.Upon accessing the vault, Thoren was met with an awe-inspiring sight – the priceless treasures of Mystis Isle glittering in the cavern's dim light. Overwhelmed by his triumphant achievement, he quietly thanked the map, a memento that led him to the treasures he’d sought. After gathering the jewels, he vowed to protect these priceless artifacts and set foot back towards Brenningrad, concluding his quest and imparting a story of bravery and discovery for generations to tell.\n",
