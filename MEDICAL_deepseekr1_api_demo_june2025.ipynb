            "3.  **Vital Signs:** Elevated BP (160/100 mmHg despite medication) indicates uncontrolled hypertension/hypertensive urgency, and tachycardia (HR 110 bpm) suggests sympathetic nervous system activation in response to cardiac stress/ischemia.\n",

            "This is a time-critical emergency. Immediate actions focus on stabilizing the patient, confirming diagnosis, and initiating reperfusion therapy if indicated.\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Primary Assessment & ABCs:**\n",
            "    *   **A (Airway):** Ensure airway is patent.\n",
            "    *   **B (Breathing):** Administer **high-flow oxygen** via non-rebreather mask (especially with SOB and potential hypoxia). Monitor oxygen saturation.\n",
            "    *   **C (Circulation):**\n",
            "        *   Secure IV access (x 2 large-bore cannulas).\n",
            "        *   Attach **ECG monitor** and **defibrillator pads** (anticipating potential arrhythmias).\n",
            "        *   Obtain a **12-lead ECG IMMEDIATELY** (<10 mins from first medical contact). This is critical to differentiate STEMI (ST-Elevation MI) from NSTEMI/Unstable Angina.\n",
            "        *   Check BP frequently.\n",
            "    *   **Brief History & Exam:** Quickly confirm history, allergies (especially aspirin, contrast), medications (specifically PDE5 inhibitors like sildenafil/viagra in last 24-48 hrs), and perform a focused physical exam (heart/lung sounds).\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Immediate Medical Therapy (MONA-BASH Modified - Focus on initial actions):**\n",
            "    *   **M - Morphine:** Use cautiously *only if pain is severe and unrelieved* by nitroglycerin. (Note: Morphine use is now more controversial; consider alternatives like Fentanyl if needed, prioritizing anti-ischemic meds first).\n",
            "    *   **O - Oxygen:** As above.\n",
            "    *   **N - Nitroglycerin (NTG):** Give **sublingual nitroglycerin** (0.4 mg) every 5 minutes (up to 3 doses) if systolic BP is >90 mmHg and no recent PDE5 inhibitor use. *Relieves pain/preload, may help hypertension.*\n",
            "    *   **A - Aspirin:** Give **chewable aspirin** (162-325 mg) immediately. *Irreversibly inhibits platelets.*\n",
            "    *   **B - Beta-blocker:** Consider **IV Metoprolol** (if no contraindications like heart failure, bradycardia, heart block, asthma/COPD, hypotension) - *reduces heart rate, BP, myocardial oxygen demand*. (e.g., 5mg slow IV push, repeated every 5 mins up to 15mg if tolerated).\n",
            "    *   **A - Anticoagulant:** Start an **anticoagulant** (e.g., IV **Unfractionated Heparin** bolus/infusion, or **Subcutaneous Enoxaparin**, or **Bivalirudin**) *after* confirming no bleeding risk. *Prevents thrombus extension.*\n",
            "    *   **S - Statin:** Administer a high-intensity **statin** (e.g., **Atorvastatin 80 mg**). *Plaque stabilization, anti-inflammatory.*\n",

            "\n",

            "    *   **Repeat ECGs:** Especially if pain persists or changes, or initial ECG is non-diagnostic.\n",

            "        *   **ACTIVATE CATH LAB IMMEDIATELY.**\n",
            "        *   **Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI):** Gold standard - goal is balloon inflation within **90 minutes** of first medical contact.\n",
            "        *   **Fibrinolysis:** If PCI cannot be achieved within 120 minutes of first medical contact and no contraindications, administer fibrinolytic therapy (e.g., Tenecteplase, Alteplase). *Must rule out contraindications (e.g., bleeding, stroke history, recent surgery).*\n",
            "    *   **IF NSTEMI/Unstable Angina (No ST Elevation, but Troponin positive or high clinical suspicion):**\n",
            "        *   Admit to coronary care unit (CCU).\n",
            "        *   Continue aggressive medical therapy (DAPT - Aspirin + a P2Y12 inhibitor like Ticagrelor/Prasugrel/Clopidogrel, Anticoagulant, Statin, Beta-blocker, Nitrates).\n",
            "        *   Perform **early invasive strategy** (cardiac catheterization) typically within 24 hours (often sooner for high-risk features like ongoing pain, hemodynamic instability, arrhythmias - which this patient has).\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Ongoing Monitoring & Management:**\n",
            "    *   Continuous ECG monitoring for arrhythmias (VT, VF, bradycardias).\n",
            "    *   Strict bed rest initially.\n",
            "    *   Pain control.\n",
            "    *   Manage hypertension (IV NTG drip often used if BP remains elevated).\n",
            "    *   Treat nausea/vomiting (e.g., Ondansetron).\n",
            "    *   Serial cardiac markers and ECGs.\n",

            "**Key Principles:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Time is Muscle:** Every minute of delay increases myocardial damage.\n",
            "*   **ECG within 10 Minutes:** This dictates the most critical next steps (PCI vs. Fibrinolysis vs. medical management).\n",
            "*   **Aspirin Immediately:** Unless true allergy.\n",
            "*   **Activate Cath Lab for STEMI:** This is the single most important action for a STEMI patient.\n",
            "*   **Treat Hypertension/Angina:** Nitroglycerin is first-line if BP permits.\n",
            "*   **Treat Tachycardia:** Beta-blockers are key if no contraindications.\n",
