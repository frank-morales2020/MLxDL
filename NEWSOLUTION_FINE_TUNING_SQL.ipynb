        "Absolutely! Let's describe the dataflow in the provided code, breaking it down step-by-step:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Input and Preparation:**\n",
        "   - The process begins by loading the \"sql-create-context\" dataset, which presumably contains pairs of natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries.\n",
        "   - The dataset is divided into three distinct subsets: training, validation, and testing.\n",
        "   - The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 language model and its tokenizer are loaded and prepared.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Data Transformation with `TextToSQLDataset`:**\n",
        "   - The `TextToSQLDataset` class is responsible for converting raw data into a format suitable for model training and evaluation.\n",
        "   - For each data sample, the following transformations occur:\n",
        "      - Tokenization: The input question and the SQL query (answer) are tokenized using the loaded tokenizer.\n",
        "      - Dependency Parsing: The question is parsed using spaCy to extract the grammatical relationships between words, generating a dependency graph.\n",
        "      - Dictionary Creation: A dictionary is created to store the tokenized input IDs, attention masks, labels (tokenized SQL query), and the dependency edges extracted from parsing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Batching and Shuffling with `DataLoader`:**\n",
        "   - `DataLoader` takes the processed dataset from `TextToSQLDataset` and creates an iterable object for efficient batching.\n",
        "   - Optionally, shuffling is applied to randomize the order of samples within each epoch during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Forward Pass through `GraphModel`:**\n",
        "   - **Mistral Encoder:** The tokenized input IDs and attention masks are fed into the Mistral model's encoder to obtain contextualized token embeddings.\n",
        "   - **GATv2 Layer:** The GATv2 layer (Graph Attention Network) takes the token embeddings and the dependency edges as input. It applies graph attention mechanisms to incorporate the structural information from the dependency graph into the token representations.\n",
        "   - **Pooling:** The node representations (output of GATv2) are aggregated using a pooling operation (e.g., mean pooling) to obtain a fixed-size representation of the entire input sequence.\n",
        "   - **LM Head:** The pooled representation is passed through a linear layer, which produces logits â€“ unnormalized probabilities for each token in the vocabulary.\n",
        "   - **Loss Calculation:** During training, if labels (correct SQL queries) are available, the cross-entropy loss is calculated between the predicted logits and the true labels. This loss guides the optimization of the model's parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Model Optimization with PEFT (LoRA):**\n",
        "   - The `GraphModel` is wrapped with PEFT's LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configuration to enable parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n",
        "   - During training, only the parameters of the GATv2 layer and the LM head are updated, while the rest of the model parameters remain frozen.\n",
        "   - The Hugging Face Trainer manages the training process, iterating over the dataset, computing gradients, and updating the model's parameters based on the calculated loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Evaluation:**\n",
        "   - After (or during) training, the model is evaluated on the validation and test sets.\n",
        "   - The `compute_metrics` function decodes the predicted logits and labels back into text and assesses the model's performance using two metrics:\n",
        "      - Semantic Similarity: This metric measures how semantically close the predicted SQL query is to the reference SQL query using SentenceTransformer embeddings.\n",
        "      - Exact Match: This metric checks if the predicted SQL query matches the reference SQL query exactly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Output:**\n",
        "    - The final output is the evaluation results, including semantic similarity and exact match scores, which provide insights into the model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries from natural language questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me know if you have any further questions or would like clarification on any of the steps!\n"

Fine-tuning involves training a pre-trained model on a new task, and only a subset of the parameters are typically updated to adapt the model to the specific task.\n",
