            "CrewAI is a framework designed for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. Its primary purpose is to enable multiple agents, each with defined roles, goals, and tools, to collaborate on complex tasks. Instead of interacting with a single agent sequentially or manually managing tool calls, CrewAI allows you to define a 'crew' of agents that work together through a defined process to achieve a collective objective.\n",
            "It abstracts away much of the complexity of managing multi-agent workflows, communication, and task execution.\n"
