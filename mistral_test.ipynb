            "Answer:  Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting of models. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, including the noise and errors in the data. As a result, the model may not generalize well to new data and may not make accurate predictions. \n",
            "\n",
            "Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function of the model, which encourages the model to have smaller coefficients or weights. This results in a simpler model that is less likely to overfit the data. There are two main types of regularization: L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty term equal to the absolute value of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term equal to the square of the coefficients.\n",
