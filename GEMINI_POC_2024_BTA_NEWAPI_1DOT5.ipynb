            "\n",
            "**Possible Plan:**\n",

The airport also has free Wi-Fi, so he can catch up on emails or plan the next leg of his trip.  He could find a restaurant within his budget for a good meal.\n",

            "* **Time:** 2:00 PM - 6:00 PM (allowing 2 hours for airport procedures)\n",
            "* **Activities:** Take the free Skylink train to Terminal D and follow signs for the Founder's Plaza Observation Area. This gives him great views of the airport and planes taking off and landing.  It's a perfect spot for plane enthusiasts and photographers.  There are picnic tables if he wants to pack some snacks. He can grab a quick and inexpensive meal at the airport before heading out.\n",

            "* **Time:** 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM (allowing 2 hours for airport procedures)\n",
            "* **Activities:**  Grapevine is a charming historic town a short distance from DFW.  He can take a taxi or rideshare (budget around $30-40 roundtrip).  He'll have about 2 hours to explore Main Street, browse the shops, and enjoy the quaint atmosphere. He could grab a quick bite at a local deli or cafe. Note: this option is tighter on time and budget.\n",

            "* **Terminal Transfers:**  DFW is large, so factor in time for inter-terminal travel. The Skylink train is efficient and free.\n",
