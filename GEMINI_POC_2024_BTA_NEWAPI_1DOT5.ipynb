            "\n",
            "* **$100 budget:**  This is a TIGHT budget for food, transportation, and activities at an airport. We'll prioritize free activities and affordable food options. \n",

            "\n",
            "**1. Airport Exploration (1 hour):**\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Option A (Budget-Friendly):** DFW has a decent selection of grab-and-go options.  Bob could find a tasty sandwich or salad for under $15.\n",
            "* **Option B (Splurge):** If Bob wants to use a chunk of his budget on a nice meal, he could find a sit-down restaurant.  He should check online menus beforehand to compare prices. \n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Free Entertainment (2 hours):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **DFW Observation Deck:** The airport has an observation deck offering great views of the airfield. It's free and perfect for an aviation enthusiast.\n",
            "* **Airport Lounges (Consider a Day Pass):**  Some lounges offer day passes for around $50. This would give Bob a comfortable place to relax, access to Wi-Fi, snacks, and drinks. This could be a good option if he wants a quieter environment to unwind.\n",

            "**5. Relax and Recharge (1 hour):**\n",

            "**Important Notes:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Time Buffer:** This plan assumes Bob's flight arrives and departs on time. He should build in buffer time in case of delays.\n",
            "* **Transportation:**  DFW has a free inter-terminal train, the Skylink.  He won't need to pay for transportation within the airport.\n",
            "* **Research:** Bob should check the DFW Airport website or app for the most up-to-date information on restaurant options, lounge locations, and any special events happening during his layover.\n",

This option might take a couple of hours.\n",
