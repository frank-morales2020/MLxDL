        "Explanation and Key Learnings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Specialized Agents (FlightSearchAgent, HotelBookingAgent):\n",
        "\n",
        "* *  Each is an independent AgentExecutor with its own llm, tools, and prompt tailored to its specific domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Their run() method simulates an API endpoint, taking a query and returning a response.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * They internally use their own specialized tools (e.g., _search_flights_tool) which represent calls to actual external APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. API-Ready Proxies (Tools for Orchestrator):\n",
        "\n",
        "* * call_flight_search_agent and call_hotel_booking_agent are LangChain tools for the orchestrator_agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Crucially, the implementation of these tools is to call the run() method of the respective specialized agent instances. This simulates one agent making an API call to another agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Orchestrator Agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * This is the user-facing agent. Its prompt guides it to understand user intent and choose which specialized agent (via its proxy tool) to invoke.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * It doesn't directly call the external Flight or Hotel APIs; it delegates to the specialized agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Cross-Agent Communication Architecture:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * This setup demonstrates a hierarchical multi-agent system. The orchestrator acts as a coordinator, delegating tasks to expert agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Context Hand-off: The orchestrator extracts relevant parts of the user's query and passes it as a new query to the specialized agent. The specialized agent then processes this new context.\n",
        "For more complex hand-offs, you'd serialize memory, specific extracted entities, or summarized conversation history.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Language-Agnostic Endpoints (Conceptual): While our example uses Python function calls, in a real system, FlightSearchAgent.run() and HotelBookingAgent.run() would typically be exposed via HTTP endpoints (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI).\n",
        "The call_..._agent tools would then make HTTP requests to these endpoints, making the underlying implementation language irrelevant to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture provides a powerful way to build complex AI systems by breaking them down into manageable, interoperable components, much like microservices. It's a foundational step towards building the comprehensive and intelligent flight planning AI agent we envision.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Logging and Tracing Agent Decisions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Logging: Recording discrete events (e.g., agent starts, tool calls, LLM calls, final answers, errors) to files or a logging system.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Tracing: Capturing the entire execution path of an agent, including all its internal thoughts, actions, observations, and tool calls, providing a chronological flow. This is crucial for understanding why an agent made a particular decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Callback Mechanisms in LangChain & LangGraph:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * LangChain (and LangGraph) provides a powerful Callback system. This allows you to \"hook into\" various stages of an LLM chain or agent execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * You can define custom callback handlers that execute specific code (e.g., logging to a database, sending metrics to a monitoring system, printing to console) whenever an event occurs (e.g., LLM starts/ends, tool starts/ends, chain starts/ends).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Tracking Token Usage, Latency, Success Rate:\n",
        "\n",

        "Explanation and Key Learnings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. BaseCallbackHandler: This is the core class in LangChain for creating custom monitoring. You inherit from it and override specific on_... methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Event Hooks:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * on_chain_start/on_chain_end: Triggered when any LangChain Runnable (including agents) starts or finishes. Great for tracking overall run duration.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * on_llm_start/on_llm_end: Triggered for every LLM call. on_llm_end provides response.llm_output.token_usage which contains prompt_tokens, completion_tokens, and total_tokens.\n",
        "on_tool_start/on_tool_end/\n",
        "\n",
        "* * on_tool_error: Triggered when a tool is invoked. Useful for tracking tool usage, success/failure, and individual tool latency.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * on_agent_action/on_agent_finish: Specific to agents, showing the agent's chosen action and its final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Passing Callbacks Down the Chain: Notice how callbacks is passed from the orchestrator's invoke call down to the run methods of FlightSearchAgent and HotelBookingAgent. This ensures that a single MyAgentMonitor instance tracks events across the entire nested agent hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. run_id and parent_run_id: These UUIDs are crucial for tracing. Each event (LLM call, tool call, chain execution) has a unique run_id. parent_run_id links it to the larger execution trace, allowing you to reconstruct the full flow (e.g., an LLM call within a tool call within an agent chain).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Metrics Captured:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Total Calls: llm_calls, tool_calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Latency: Calculated using start_time and end_time for chains.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Token Usage: Aggregated from on_llm_end events.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Errors: Captured via on_tool_error (you could also add on_llm_error, on_chain_error).\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Execution Trace: run_history provides a sequential log of events within each run."

        "\n",
        "1. Introduction to Tools, Agents, and Autonomous Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Tools: These are functions, APIs, or external systems that an LLM agent can use to interact with the real world or access information beyond its training data (e.g., our search_flights_api, get_airport_info tools).\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Agents: An agent is an LLM enhanced with tools and a reasoning engine (often a prompt that guides its thought process). It can autonomously decide when and how to use its tools to achieve a goal. This autonomous behavior is what allows it to go beyond single-turn responses to multi-step problem-solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Autonomous Behavior: The ability of an agent to plan, execute, and adapt its actions without constant human intervention, driven by its internal reasoning and external observations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Tools for Building Multi-Agent Systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * LangChain Agents: As we've seen, LangChain provides a robust framework (AgentExecutor, create_tool_calling_agent, tools) to define agents, equip them with capabilities, and manage their execution loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * LangChain Toolkits: LangChain offers pre-built toolkits (e.g., for Wikipedia, Google Search, various APIs) that you can easily integrate into your agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Other Frameworks: Beyond LangChain, frameworks like CrewAI and AutoGen (Microsoft) are specifically designed to facilitate multi-agent collaboration, offering more advanced patterns for task delegation, communication, and human-in-the-loop interactions. These often abstract away some of the communication complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Designing Task-Specific Agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "In a multi-agent system, each agent typically has a specialized role, much like departments in a company:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Planner Agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "* * * Role: Takes a high-level user request and breaks it down into a sequence of smaller, actionable sub-tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * * Output: A structured list of tasks for the Executor.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * * Flight Planning Example: User asks \"Plan a summer trip to Europe.\" Planner might output: \"1. Find flights to Paris. 2. Find hotels in Paris. 3. Find flights from Paris to Rome. 4. Find hotels in Rome. 5. Summarize itinerary.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Executor Agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "Role: Receives a specific task from the Planner and executes it using its own set of specialized tools. It might delegate to other sub-agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: The results of the executed task (e.g., flight options, hotel details).\n",
        "\n",
        "Flight Planning Example: Receives \"Find flights to Paris,\" then calls the FlightSearchAgent's API (our call_flight_search_agent tool).\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Summarizer/Reporter Agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "Role: Takes raw results from the Executor(s) and synthesizes them into a coherent, user-friendly summary or report.\n",
        "\n",
        "Output: The final answer presented to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flight Planning Example: Combines flight and hotel details into a readable itinerary with dates, times, and prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * Evaluator/Critic Agent (Optional but powerful):\n",
        "\n",
        "* * * Role: Reviews the output or actions of other agents for correctness, completeness, or adherence to constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * * Flight Planning Example: Checks if all segments of a multi-city trip are covered, or if the proposed flights fit the user's budget.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Communication Protocols Between Agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of communication protocol depends on the complexity, scale, and deployment environment:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Direct Function Calls (Local Simulation): As in our \"Hands-on\" example below, Python functions can directly call each other. Simple for local testing.\n",
        "\n",
        "* HTTP/REST APIs (Microservices): Each agent exposes its capabilities via a RESTful API. Agents communicate by making HTTP requests. This is common for distributed deployments.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Message Queues (Asynchronous Communication): Agents publish tasks/results to a central message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SQS). Other agents subscribe to relevant topics. This enables decoupled, asynchronous, and scalable communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Shared Databases/Knowledge Bases: Agents can write and read structured information to/from a shared database or vector store.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol: As discussed, this emerging standard aims to provide a universal, structured, and secure way for agents to communicate, abstracting away underlying transport mechanisms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hands-on: Create a Multi-Agent System for a Business Use Case (Trip Planning)\n",
        "We will build a simple multi-agent system for trip planning, comprising:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Planner Agent: Determines the sub-tasks for a trip.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Executor Agent: Calls specialized tools (our FlightSearchAgent and HotelBookingAgent from previous examples) to perform the tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Summarizer Agent: Compiles the results into a final itinerary.\n",
        "\n",

        "Traditional AgentExecutor from LangChain is excellent for linear \"Thought-Action-Observation\" loops. However, real-world problems often require:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Non-linear flows: Branching based on conditions (e.g., \"If flight found, then ask for hotel; else, suggest alternative dates\").\n",
        "\n",
        "* Loops/Cycles: Iterating (e.g., \"Keep searching until a suitable flight is found\" or \"Refine answer until satisfactory\").\n",
        "\n",
        "* Complex Dependencies: Multiple sub-tasks running in parallel or sequentially with intricate data hand-offs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stateful Transitions: The ability for the workflow to \"remember\" its current progress and make decisions based on accumulating information.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph solves this by adopting a state machine and graph-based approach. You define nodes (steps) and edges (transitions between steps), allowing for explicit control over the flow, including cycles and conditional routing.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Practical Guide to Coordinated LLM Agents Using LangGraph:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Nodes (functions or agents): Each node in a LangGraph represents a specific step in your workflow. A node can be:\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple Python function (e.g., Notes, format_output).\n",
        "An LLM call.\n",
        "A tool invocation.\n",
        "An entire LangChain AgentExecutor (allowing you to nest agents within a larger graph).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Edges (data/control flow): These define how the workflow moves from one node to another.\n",
        "Direct Edges: Unconditionally move from Node A to Node B.\n",
        "Conditional Edges: The next node is determined by a function that evaluates the current state and returns the name of the next node (or END to stop).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Cycles (iteration, self-correction): LangGraph natively supports cycles. This is how you implement looping behavior, allowing agents to iteratively refine an answer, gather more information, or retry failed operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "* State: LangGraph manages a shared state object that is passed between nodes. Each node receives the current state, performs its operations, and returns an update to the state. This allows all nodes to access and contribute to the accumulated knowledge and progress of the workflow. The state is defined using a TypedDict or a simple dict that represents the data structure of your graph's context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Add memory or context passing between agents:\n",
        "In LangGraph, memory is intrinsically tied to the state. The state object itself serves as the short-term memory of the current execution trace. You can design your state to include a messages list for conversational memory, or specific keys for extracted entities and results. LangGraph also provides Checkpointers for persisting this state to a database, enabling long-running conversations or resuming workflows after interruptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Node-based Task Design:\n",
        "Think of each node as a microservice or a single, atomic operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Atomic: Each node should ideally perform one distinct logical unit of work.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Input/Output: Clearly define what each node expects from the state and what it contributes back to the state.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Separation of Concerns: Keep your planner, executor, summarizer, and specific tool interactions in separate nodes for clarity and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Async vs Sync Execution in Agentic Flows:\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph (and LangChain) supports both synchronous (.invoke()) and asynchronous (.ainvoke(), .stream(), .astream()) execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Synchronous: Simpler to write for sequential tasks, blocking until each step completes.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Asynchronous: Essential for high-throughput, non-blocking operations, especially when dealing with network calls (LLMs, external APIs) or parallel execution. LangGraph can internally manage async operations within nodes if you define your nodes as async def functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conditional Routing and Stateful Transitions:\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a cornerstone of LangGraph. You define a \"router\" function as an edge that inspects the current state and returns the name of the next node to execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Integrating memory into LangGraph Workflows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Conversation History: A common pattern is to have a messages key in your graph state, and use LangGraph's add_messages function (or a custom reducer) to append new messages to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Structured Data: Store extracted entities, API results, or summaries directly in dedicated keys within your state.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Checkpointers: For persistence, you compile the graph with a checkpointer (e.g., InMemorySaver for development, or a database-backed one for production). This allows you to resume conversations or long-running tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Hands-on Exercises Using LangGraph\n",
        "We will build a complete trip planning system using LangGraph. This system will:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Take a user request.\n",
        "2. Use a Planner Node to break it into tasks.\n",
        "3. Use an Executor Node that conditionally calls FlightSearchAgent or HotelBookingAgent.\n",
        "4. Implement looping behavior to process multiple tasks.\n",
        "5. Use a Summarizer Node to compile results.\n",
        "6. Maintain state throughout the process.\n",
        "7. Include an Error Handling Node for robustness.\n",

        "Explanation and Key Learnings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Graph State (TravelGraphState): This is the central piece of LangGraph. It defines the schema of the information that is passed between nodes. Each node receives the current state, updates it, and returns the modified state.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Nodes (Functions):\n",
        "planner_node: Takes the initial request, uses an LLM to parse it into structured tasks, and updates state['tasks'] and state['current_task_index'].\n",
        "executor_node: This is the workhorse. It reads the current_task_index from the state, executes the corresponding task by calling our specialized flight_service.run() or hotel_service.run() (simulating API calls to other agents), and then appends the results to state['flight_results'] or state['hotel_results']. It increments current_task_index.\n",
        "summarizer_node: Takes all accumulated flight_results and hotel_results from the state and uses another LLM call to synthesize the final_itinerary.\n",
        "error_handler_node: A dedicated node to provide a graceful response if an error occurred during processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Conditional Edges (should_continue_execution): This function is the \"router\" that defines the graph's flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * It's called after the executor node.\n",
        "* * It inspects the state (specifically current_task_index and error_message).\n",
        "* * If error_message is present, it routes to error_handler.\n",
        "* * If there are more tasks to execute (current_task_index < len(tasks)), it routes back to the executor node, creating a loop.\n",
        "* * Otherwise (all tasks processed), it routes to the summarizer node.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Cycles (Looping Behavior): The edge executor -> should_continue_execution -> executor forms a cycle, enabling the graph to iteratively process each task identified by the planner.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Stateful Transitions: The state is continuously updated by each node. This allows subsequent nodes (and even subsequent iterations of the same node) to access the results and context from previous steps. For example, the summarizer_node receives all results accumulated by multiple runs of the executor_node.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Integrating Memory: The TravelGraphState itself serves as the active memory for the current workflow execution. For persistence across sessions, workflow.compile() accepts a checkpointer (e.g., InMemorySaver for local, or more robust options like SqliteSaver or Redis for production). This allows you to invoke with a thread_id and resume a previous conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Node-based Task Design: Each node has a clear, singular responsibility (planning, executing one task, summarizing, handling errors), making the system modular and easier to debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph provides a powerful, explicit, and visual way to design complex agentic workflows, moving beyond simple linear chains to truly dynamic and robust multi-agent systems for challenging tasks like flight planning."
