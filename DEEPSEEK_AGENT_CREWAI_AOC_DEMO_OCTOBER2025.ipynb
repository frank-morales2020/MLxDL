            "\n",
            "4. **Long-Haul and International Considerations**:\n",
            "   - **Route Alignment**: For wide-body aircraft, schedule maintenance at hub stations after long-haul flights (e.g., post-flight from Asia to Europe). This reduces ferry time and utilizes natural ground time.\n",
            "   - **Parts Availability**: Establish partnerships with suppliers at key international stations (e.g., Dubai, Singapore) for rapid parts delivery. Use real-time tracking to avoid shortages.\n",
            "   - **Extended Windows**: Plan for potential extensions in wide-body checks (up to 24 hours) due to system complexity. Build buffer time into schedules.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Ensuring Airworthiness and Minimizing Disruption\n",
            "- **Proactive Monitoring**: Use aircraft health monitoring systems to predict maintenance needs and adjust schedules dynamically.\n",
            "- **Communication**: Coordinate with operations control to align maintenance with flight schedules, ensuring minimal impact on passenger routes.\n",
            "- **Contingency Planning**: Keep reserve aircraft or swap schedules if delays occur. For example, if a wide-body check overruns, use a narrow-body for short-haul reroutes.\n",
            "\n",
            "This approach balances maintenance requirements with operational efficiency. I recommend reviewing this schedule bi-weekly with your operations team to adapt to changing flight patterns. If you provide specific fleet details or current flight hour data, I can refine it further!\n",
