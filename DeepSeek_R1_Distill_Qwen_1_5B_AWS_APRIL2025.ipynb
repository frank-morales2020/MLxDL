        "The first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning. With RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.\n",

        "NOTE: Before running DeepSeek-R1 series models locally or creating an endpoint, we kindly recommend reviewing the Usage Recommendation section and adhering to JumpStart default settings.\n",

        "2. Model Summary\n",
        "Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\n",
        "\n",
        "We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is the pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too\n",
        "\n",
        "It demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.\n",
        "Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community."

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Response #1:  To start, let me think... If I have 6 kids and each cone is $1.25, then the total cost is 6 multiplied by $1.25. So, 6 times 1.25 equals... Hmm, that's 7.50. Okay, so the total is $7.50. I paid with a $10 bill. So, the change should be $10 minus $7.50. Let me compute that: $10 minus $7.50 is $2.50. So, I'd get back $2.50. Is that correct?\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait a second, I've heard before that sometimes there are cents that can affect the exact change. Did I handle the cents right? Let's break it down. Each cone is $1.25, which is 1 dollar and 25 cents. So, for 6 cones, if I have to add that six times, let's see:\n",
            "\n",
            "Start with 6 times 1 dollar, that's $6.00. Then, 6 times 25 cents is 150 cents. So, the total is $6.00 plus $1.50, which is $7.50. So, yes, that checks out. Then, I pay with $10, so I subtract $7.50 from $10.00.\n",
            "\n",
            "But another way to compute this is, since $10 is equal to $10.00, subtract $7.00 first, which leaves me with $0.50. Then, from the 50 cents, I need to subtract the remaining 0.50 from the $7.50, which again gives me $2.50. Alternatively, I can do it step by step. Let me write out the subtraction:\n",
            "\n",
            "```\n",
            "10.00\n",
            "-7.50\n",
            "-------\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting from the right, subtract 0 - 0, which is 0. Then, 0 - 5: I can't do that, so I have to borrow 1 from the dollar place. So, the 0 becomes 10, and I subtract 5, which is 5. Now, the dollar place was 0, but we borrowed 1, so it becomes 9. Then, 9 - 7, which is 2. So, the result is 2 in the dollar place and 5 in the cents place, making it 2.50.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, is there a chance that when subtracting, I might have to deal with more precise decimals? Let me try another approach. If I consider that $1.25 is 5/4 dollars, because 1 dollar is 1, and 25 cents is 0.25, so 1.25 equals 5/4. So, 6 times 5/4 is (6 * 5)/4, which is 30/4, which is 7.50. Same result.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, thinking about it in fractions, maybe it's easier to convert everything into cents. So, $10 is 1000 cents, and $7.50 is 750 cents. So, subtracting 750 from 1000 gives 250 cents. Since 100 cents is a dollar, 250 cents is 2 dollars and 50 cents. So, $2.50. That solidifies the answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "But wait, is there a discrepancy between some systems where amounts are rounded? Hmm, no, in this case, we're dealing with exact cents and multiples of cents, so 1.25 is exact, and 6 cones would be exact at 7.50. So, subtracting from 10 gives 2.50, exact as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, is there any chance that the question might have been about discounts or something else? The problem says each cone was $1.25, and I paid with a $10 bill. So, no discounts or deals or anything else. So, 6 cones at $1.25 each, that's 7.50, which subtracted from 10 leaves 2.50. Therefore, the change is $2.50.\n",
            "\n",
            "But just to verify once more, because sometimes when I do mental math, I might slip. Let me think about it another way. If each cone is $1.25, then half a cone would be $0.625. So, for 6 cones, that's 3 half-cones, which would be 1.875 dollars. So, 6 cones: each cone is $1.25, so 6 times $1.25. Alternatively, 6 times 1 is 6, 6 times 0.25 is 1.50, total 7.50.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, if I think about this in another way, 10 - 7 is 3, so 10 - 7.50 is 2.50. Alternatively, using decimal subtraction step by step:\n",

            "\n",
            "So, you subtract $7 from $10, giving you $3, and then 10 cents minus 50 cents is a problem, but wait, no, wait: When subtracting 7.50 from 10.00, you can't just subtract 7 from 10 and then 0.5 from 0.0 because you have to subtract both. So, 10.00 - 7.50 is like 10.00 - (7 + 0.5) = (10 - 7) - 0.5 = 3 - 0.5 = 2.50.\n",

            "Alternatively, using coins, but that would be time-consuming because it's about 6.50, but here it's 7.50, which is a clean amount. So, in coins, if you have a $10 bill, that is 10 one-dollar coins, which when you pay 7.50, the change is 2.50 in coins, which is 2 one-dollar coins and 5 quarters.
