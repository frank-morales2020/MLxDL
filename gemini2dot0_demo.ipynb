            "Clementine was, by all accounts, a rather ordinary tabby cat. She enjoyed sunbeams, chasing dust bunnies, and napping in cardboard boxes. But Clementine harbored a secret longing for something more, something beyond the confines of her suburban backyard. She dreamed of the fluffy white clouds that drifted lazily across the sky.\n",
            "\n",
            "One crisp autumn morning, while her humans were preoccupied with preparing for a local festival, Clementine spotted it: a magnificent, striped hot air balloon tethered in the adjacent field. The vibrant fabric rippled in the gentle breeze, beckoning her closer. Curiosity, a powerful feline motivator, got the better of her.\n",
            "\n",
            "Slipping through the unlatched gate, Clementine padded towards the behemoth. The air was thick with the smell of propane and the murmur of excited voices. A low wooden basket sat beneath the enormous balloon, its wicker weave a tempting scratching post. With a nimble leap, she landed inside.\n",
            "\n",
            "The crew, busy with their final preparations, hadn't noticed the small stowaway. The roar of the burner startled her, making her fur stand on end, but the thrill of the unknown kept her rooted to the spot. Suddenly, the basket lurched, and Clementine felt the ground fall away beneath her paws.\n",
            "\n",
            "They were rising! The field shrank into a patchwork quilt of green and gold. Clementine peered over the edge, her green eyes wide with wonder. Below, cars looked like tiny toys and houses resembled miniature blocks. The wind whipped through her whiskers, carrying the scent of crisp leaves and distant woodsmoke.\n",
            "\n",
            "The view was breathtaking. Clementine had never seen anything like it. She watched as birds soared below her, their silhouettes stark against the blue sky. They looked so small! It was a perspective she’d never imagined. She felt a strange mix of fear and exhilaration.\n",
            "\n",
            "The balloon drifted silently over rolling hills, the landscape changing from farm fields to patches of forest. Clementine, no longer just a housecat, felt like a daring explorer. She even managed a dignified sniff at the open flame of the burner, quickly deciding it was far too hot to investigate further.\n",
            "\n",
            "She spent the next hour mesmerized by the world unfolding beneath her. She saw a flock of sheep scattering across a field, a meandering river snaking its way through the valley, and a group of people waving excitedly from a hilltop.  She even saw another cat lounging on a window ledge, seemingly unimpressed with her skyward adventure.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the sun began to dip towards the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues, the pilot began to descend. The gentle descent was just as thrilling as the ascent. Finally, with a soft bump, the balloon landed back in the field.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clementine, a little dusty but full of the thrill of adventure, hopped out of the basket as the crew deflated the giant fabric above.  She stretched, shook her fur, and took one last look at the magnificent balloon before padding back towards the familiar comfort of her home.\n",
            "\n",
            "Back in her own backyard, curled up in her favorite sunbeam, Clementine wasn't quite the same ordinary cat. She still enjoyed sunbeams and chasing dust bunnies, but now she carried a secret within her – the memory of flying above the world, a silent, striped adventurer soaring through the sky.  And every time she looked up at the clouds, she would remember the day she went on the greatest adventure of her nine lives, aboard a hot air balloon. And maybe, just maybe, she’d start dreaming of flying again.\n",

            "**Explanation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Function Definition:**\n",
            "   - The code defines a function called `factorial(n)` that takes one argument, `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer.\n",
            "   - It includes a docstring that explains the purpose of the function, its arguments, and what it returns.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Error Handling:**\n",
            "   - It first checks if `n` is negative using `if n < 0:`. If it is, it raises a `ValueError` with a message indicating that factorials are not defined for negative numbers. This is important for robust code.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Base Case:**\n",
            "   - If `n` is 0, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1. This is the base case for the recursive definition of factorials.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Iterative Calculation:**\n",
            "   - If `n` is a positive integer, the function uses a `for` loop to calculate the factorial iteratively.\n",
            "   - `result` is initialized to 1.\n",
            "   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n",
            "   - In each iteration, `result` is multiplied by the current value of `i`.\n",
            "   - After the loop completes, `result` contains the factorial of `n`.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Return Value:**\n",
            "   - Finally, the function returns the calculated `result`.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Example Usage:**\n",
            "   - The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block demonstrates how to use the `factorial` function.\n",
            "   - It calls the function with different input values and prints the results.\n",
            "   - It also includes a `try-except` block to show how the `ValueError` is handled when a negative input is provided.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Key Concepts Used:**\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Function Definition:** Creating reusable blocks of code.\n",
            "- **Error Handling:** Using `ValueError` to handle invalid inputs.\n",
            "- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):**  Controlling the flow of execution based on conditions.\n",
            "- **Loops (`for`):**  Iterating through a sequence of values.\n",
            "- **Iteration:** Performing actions repeatedly.\n",
            "- **Docstrings:** Providing clear documentation within the code.\n",
            "- **`if __name__ == '__main__':`:** Ensures that the example usage block only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n",
            "\n",
            "This function provides a clear, efficient, and well-documented way to calculate factorials in Python.\n",
