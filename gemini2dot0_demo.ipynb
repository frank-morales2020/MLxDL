Her days were a gentle rhythm of purrs, head-butts, and chasing dust bunnies. That is, until the day the giant, colorful bubble appeared in her backyard.\n",

            "It wasn't just any bubble, of course. It was a hot air balloon, vibrant stripes of red, yellow, and blue billowing in the gentle breeze. A kindly old man, his face etched with the maps of a thousand smiles, was tethering it to the rose bush. He looked like someone who told secrets to the wind. \n",
            "\n",
            "Clementine, usually aloof, was captivated. Her emerald eyes widened as the balloon swayed, the wicker basket beneath looking suspiciously like the perfect napping spot. Curiosity, a foreign but exhilarating sensation, pricked her whiskers.\n",

            "Below, the familiar garden shrank into a patchwork of green and color. Clementine gripped the edge of the basket, her claws sinking slightly into the wicker. She'd never been so high, soâ€¦uncontrolled. A bird swooped past, its song a tiny melody in the vast blue. Clementine puffed up, a mix of fear and excitement making her fur stand on end.\n",

            "The old man, whose name she learned was Silas, pointed out landmarks below: a shimmering river, a field of sunflowers that looked like a carpet of gold, a tiny town where houses huddled together like sleeping kittens.

The sun warmed her coat, and she discovered the joy of just being. The world felt so big, and she, a little cat, was a part of it. She even chased a stray butterfly that dared to venture too close to the basket, batting at it with playful swipes.\n",

And she knew, deep in her feline heart, that this was only the beginning of her explorations.\n",

Factorials are not defined for negative numbers.\\n   - `raise ValueError(\\\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\\\")`: If `n` is negative, a `ValueError` is raised with an informative error message. This stops the function execution and alerts the user to the invalid input.\\n\\n3. **Base Case (0!):**\\n   - `elif n == 0:`: If `n` is 0, the function returns 1 because the factorial of 0 is defined as 1. This is a base case for the recursive process (which is not used here but can be).\\n\\n4. **Iterative Calculation:**\\n   - `else:`: If `n` is a positive integer, the code enters this block.\\n   - `result = 1`: A variable `result` is initialized to 1. This will store the factorial value.\\n   - `for i in range(1, n + 1):`: A `for` loop iterates from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).\\n   - `result *= i`: Inside the loop, `result` is multiplied by the current value of `i`. This cumulatively calculates the factorial (1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n).\\n   - `return result`: Finally, the calculated `result` (the factorial of `n`) is returned.\\n\\n5. **Test Cases (in `if __name__ == '__main__':`)**\\n   - `if __name__ == '__main__':` ensures that the code block inside only executes when the script is run directly. This allows you to add test examples within the file.\\n   - Test cases with expected outputs are printed to the console.\\n   - An error case is tested to show the `ValueError` is raised when trying to calculate the factorial of a negative number.\\n\\n**How the Factorial is Calculated:**\\n\\nThe factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. \\n\\nFor example:\\n- 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120\\n- 0! = 1 (by definition)\\n- Factorials are not defined for negative integers.\\n\\nThis function uses an iterative approach to calculate the factorial. You could also calculate the factorial recursively; however, the iterative approach is usually more efficient for larger numbers as it avoids recursion stack limits.\\n\"\n",
