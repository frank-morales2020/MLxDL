            "   - Reduced visibility due to rain, which may affect landing procedures\n",

            "3. The higher wind speed at the destination (Toronto) may require adjustments to approach and landing techniques.\n",
            "4. Extra caution should be exercised during landing due to the wet runway conditions in Toronto.\n",
            "5. The flight crew should monitor weather updates throughout the flight, as conditions may change.\n",
            "6. Passengers should be advised of possible turbulence, especially during descent into Toronto.\n",
            "\n",

            "Analysis:\n",
            "1. Timing: \n",
            "   - AC123 is an early morning flight, which might be preferable for business travelers or those who want to maximize their day in Toronto.\n",

            "3. Price:\n",
            "   AC123 is $50 cheaper than WJ456.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Weather conditions:\n",
            "   Without specific weather information, I can't factor this into the recommendation. If weather data were available, it would be important to consider how it might affect each flight's departure and arrival times.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendation:\n",
            "Based on the available information, I would recommend flight AC123 as the optimal choice for the following reasons:\n",
            "1. It's the earlier flight, allowing for more time in Toronto upon arrival.\n",
            "2. It's $50 cheaper than the alternative.\n",
            "3. The flight duration is the same as the later flight.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, this recommendation might change if:\n",
            "- The weather conditions significantly impact the morning flight.\n",
            "- Passenger preferences indicate a strong preference for a later departure time.\n",
            "- There are specific activities planned in Toronto that align better with the later arrival time.\n",
