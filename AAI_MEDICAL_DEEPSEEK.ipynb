            "Patient presents with concerning symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, with a significant past medical history of coronary artery disease. The ECG shows sinus tachycardia with ST depression in leads V3-V4, which is highly suggestive of myocardial ischemia.\n",

            "2. **Continuous Cardiac Monitoring** - Patient should be placed on cardiac monitoring\n",
            "3. **IV Access and Supplemental Oxygen** - Establish IV access and provide oxygen as needed\n",
            "4. **Additional Testing** - Cardiac enzymes are pending and will help rule out acute myocardial infarction\n",
