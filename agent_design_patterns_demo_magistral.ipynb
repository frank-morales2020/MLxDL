            "   - The query mentions \"a cheap flight,\" which directly points to a flight search.\n",

            "- Trip Dates: next month\n",
            "- Passengers: 1\n",
            "\n",
            "But just to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's think about the other possibilities:\n",
            "- **Hotel Search**: The query doesn't mention anything about hotels or accommodations.\n",
            "- **Full Itinerary**: There's no mention of a full itinerary, just a flight.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, it's definitely a flight search.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's format this into the required JSON structure.\n",
            "\n",
            "The intent is 'flight_search', and the arguments are:\n",
            "- origin: 'London Heathrow (LHR)'\n",

            "Now, let's write the JSON string:\n",

The query doesn't specify one-way or round trip, but typically, when people say \"a flight from A to B,\" it's often one-way unless specified otherwise. However, in common usage, many people might imply a round trip when they say \"a flight from A to B\" without specifying. But since it's not explicitly stated, it's safer to assume it's a one-way flight unless more context is given. But looking back at the problem, it only asks for the details as given, and doesn't mention anything about round trip or one-way. So, perhaps it's not necessary to include that information unless specified.\n",

            "Therefore, our initial conclusion holds.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now, let's think about if there's any other information we can extract. The user asked for a \"cheap\" flight. Is that a preference that should be included? The problem statement specifies the fields to extract for each intent. For flight search, it lists origin, destination, trip_dates, and passengers. It doesn't mention anything about price preferences. So, perhaps \"cheap\" is more of a qualitative descriptor rather than a parameter we need to extract based on the given criteria.\n",
