            "The author, growing up, worked on writing short stories and programming. They started writing short stories as a beginning writer and also began programming on an IBM 1401 in 9th grade using an early version of Fortran. Later on, they got a TRS-80 computer and wrote simple games, a rocket prediction program, and a word processor. Initially planning to study philosophy in college, they eventually switched to studying AI due to their interest sparked by a novel and a PBS documentary featuring intelligent computers.\n",

            "LISP, a programming language, is discussed in the provided context. It is highlighted that LISP is interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI. The language was initially intended as a formal model of computation, different from the Turing machine. LISP's core is defined by writing an interpreter in itself, which gives it a unique power and elegance compared to other languages. John McCarthy's 1960 LISP interpreter was later translated into IBM 704 machine language by his grad student Steve Russell, leading LISP to become a programming language in the ordinary sense. McCarthy's original axiomatic approach to defining LISP had limitations due to the computing power available at the time. The context also mentions the development of a new Lisp called Bel, written in Arc, with a precisely defined goal that took several years to complete.\n",
