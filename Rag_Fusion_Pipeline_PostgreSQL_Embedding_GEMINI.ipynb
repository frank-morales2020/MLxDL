            "LISP, which stands for \"LISt Processing,\" is a programming language known for its unique feature of having its core defined by writing an interpreter in itself. Originally intended as a formal model of computation, LISP was not initially designed as a conventional programming language. However, it evolved into a programming language after John McCarthy's grad student, Steve Russell, translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language. Despite its humble beginnings, LISP gained power and elegance due to its origins as a model of computation, attracting individuals like the author during college. McCarthy's 1960 LISP interpreter was limited and lacked many features expected in a programming language, leading to subsequent additions and modifications.
