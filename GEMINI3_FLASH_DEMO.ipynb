            "**Tackling the Beast: Optimizing a Million-Item Nested Loop in Python**\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay, so I've got a problem. A million items and nested loops – that spells out *disaster* in Python land. We're talking $O(n^2)$, which is a colossal $10^{12}$ operations. That's simply not feasible in standard Python without waiting an eternity. So, how do I conquer this complexity? Let's break it down.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, I need to get my head around *why* Python's nested loops are so slow. It's that darn interpreter overhead, dynamic typing, and of course, that killer quadratic complexity. Now, I have a game plan for optimization.\n",
            "\n",
            "The core of it is to find a way to *not* use nested loops, or reduce the operations that they perform. I need to be aiming for $O(n)$ or at worst, $O(n \\log n)$. If it's something like finding duplicates or matching pairs, using a set or dictionary lookup is the obvious first move.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next, vectorization with NumPy is the way to go. Python loops are inherently slow, but NumPy's core is written in C. It's like magic! I'll be using this tool's broadcasting capabilities to my advantage.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also consider specialized Python tools. The `itertools` library has some gems, `product`, and `combinations`, that are worth exploring. List comprehensions are also likely to be faster than repeated `.append()` calls.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hashing is a great strategy. Instead of brute-force comparisons in nested loops, using dictionaries or sets for lookups is lightning-fast. For instance, `set(A) & set(B)` is the way to go.\n",
            "\n",
            "If I can't vectorize, and I have pure numerical loops, then Numba's JIT compilation (@njit) should be the \"easy button\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, I might consider parallelism using the `multiprocessing` module for CPU-bound tasks, particularly if the logic within the loop is complicated and can't easily be vectorized.\n",
            "\n",
            "When I dive into a concrete scenario, I'll showcase these strategies. Let's say I'm looking for common elements or calculating distances. I'd begin with hash-based lookups. The code will showcase the slow $O(n^2)$ approach versus the slick $O(n)$ method using sets. Then, I will delve into vectorization with NumPy, explaining the SIMD magic and C-level optimization. Euclidean distance will be a great example. List comprehensions and generator expressions are worth a look, but they are unlikely to make huge gains. Lastly, I'll show how to use Numba for numerical loops and finally, I'll mention the utility of `multiprocessing` for that last boost.\n",

            "2.  **Rest Requirements:** These 4 crews (8 Pilots, 16-20 FAs) require a **10-hour minimum rest period** (with 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep) before they can be utilized for the morning bank. Hotels at SJC and OAK must be confirmed within 20 minutes to ensure the rest clock starts as soon as they clear customs/deplaning.\n",
