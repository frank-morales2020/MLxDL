Imagine if your smart speaker didn't just understand your words, but also, based on the time of day and your usual habits, *decided* to play your favorite morning music before you even asked! It's using what it learned about your patterns to make a helpful choice. My AI brain does something similar. Based on everything I've learned about you and this attic so far, I can make a suggestion. For example, if I've learned you enjoy puzzles, and I see a dusty jigsaw box over there, I might *decide* to recommend we try to solve it together!\" Pips hovers, waiting for your next thought. \"You've learned so much about AI today!\"\n",
