The boardwalk allows people to walk through the environment without disturbing the natural grasses and plants on either side.

This setting could be a nature reserve, wetland, or similar protected area meant for environmental conservation and public enjoyment.

The middle portrait is of a person with swept-back hair and a serious expression, wearing a dark jacket over a blue sweater, against a muted background. The rightmost portrait features a person with wavy hair and glasses, smiling slightly, dressed in a dark shirt, against a backdrop with hints of greenery. Beneath each portrait, there is text which seems to be the names of the individuals.\n"
