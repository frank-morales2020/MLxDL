            "\n",
            "#### Step 2: Systematic Troubleshooting\n",
            "1. **Retrieve Fault Codes**: Use CMCS to retrieve any stored fault codes specifically related to the GEnx engine.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Analyze Fault Codes**:\n",
            "   - Refer to the GE GEnx Maintenance Manual (MM) and Fault Isolation Manual (FIM) for code explanations and suggested troubleshooting processes.\n",
            "   - Determine related systems and components that need attention based on codes.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Physical Inspection**:\n",
            "   - **Visual Check**: Inspect the engine nacelle, fan blades, and cowling for visible signs of damage, leaks, or foreign object debris (FOD).\n",
            "   - **Oil and Fluid Levels**: Check engine oil and hydraulic fluid levels for adequacy.\n",
            "   - **Electrical Connections**: Ensure all electrical connections and wiring harnesses are secure and free from corrosion.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Engine Performance Data**: Review recent EHM data for anomalies in engine parameters such as temperatures, pressures, and vibration levels.\n",

            "#### Step 3: Component Specific Checks\n",
            "1. **Fuel System**:\n",

            "\n",
            "#### Step 4: Address Identified Issues\n",
            "1. **Replace Faulty Components**: Replace any defective parts as identified—ensure compliance with GE and FAA standards.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Perform Required Repairs**: Conduct repairs as outlined in the GE Maintenance and Overhaul Manual.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Reassembly and System Check**: Carefully reassemble any parts removed, ensuring all connections are secure.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 5: Functional Testing\n",
            "1. **Engine Run Test**: Perform an engine run to validate repairs:\n",
            "   - Monitor all engine parameters during test.\n",
            "   - Check for leaks, abnormal vibrations, and noise.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Verify Fault Absence**: Use CMCS to ensure no fault codes are present post-repair.\n",

            "3. **Conduct Flight Test**: If necessary, schedule a test flight to ensure full operational capability.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Step 6: Documentation and Reporting\n",
            "1. **Log All Actions**: Record all diagnostics, findings, repairs, and tests conducted.\n",
            "   \n",
            "2. **Update Maintenance Records**: Ensure all maintenance records are up to date and reflect work done.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Prepare Incident Report**: If the issue was critical, prepare a report for submission to airline safety and GE, along with FAA if applicable.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Inform Crew and Operations**: Ensure communication with flight crew and operations staff about engine status and any relevant procedural changes. \n",
            "\n",
            "Following these steps will help ensure the Boeing 787's GEnx engine is thoroughly diagnosed, repaired, and returned to service in a safe and efficient manner. Always refer to the latest manuals and guidelines applicable to the specific engine variant and aircraft configuration.\n"
