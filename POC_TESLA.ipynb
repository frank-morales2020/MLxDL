            "6. **Phased Rollout with Continuous Monitoring:** Introduce the system gradually, starting with low-risk areas and closely monitoring its performance.\n",

Are the accidents related to the speed limit, the pedestrian density, or other factors entirely (e.g., road conditions, driver behavior)?\n",
